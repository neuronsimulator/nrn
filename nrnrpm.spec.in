# Organization: have the installed files in
# /usr/local/nrn
# /usr/local/iv
# and then provide symbolic links to the executables from
# /usr/local/bin
# links to the library files are performed at the moment the
# the neuron package is requested to be installed by having what
# would normally be in PercentBuild in PercentInstall
# 
# note that the version numbers (e.g. 5.3 for nrn and 15 for iv)
# are excluded from the directory names
# because rpm prohibits having multiple versions
# of the same package.  It would be possible for a user to
# change their $PATH so that executables are searched for first
# within their directory hierarchy - so that they can install different
# versions of neuron in their home dir if they desire.

Summary: Neuron for empirically-based simulations of neurons and networks of neurons.

%description
A flexible and powerful simulator of neurons and networks
NEURON is a simulation environment for developing and exercising models of neurons and networks of neurons. It is particularly well-suited to problems where cable properties of cells play an important role, possibly including extracellular potential close to the membrane), and where cell membrane properties are complex, involving many ion-specific channels, ion accumulation, and second messengers. It evolved from a long collaboration between Michael Hines and John W. Moore at the Department of Neurobiology, Duke University. Their express goal was to create a tool designed specifically for solving the equations that describe nerve cells.

NEURON has benefited from judicious revision and selective enhancement, guided and assisted by the growing number of neuroscientists who have incorporated empirically-based modeling into their research strategies. Their feedback and collaboration have led to many improvements.
