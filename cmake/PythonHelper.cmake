# Organise which Python versions are to be built against, and find their versions, include
# directories and library paths. This is used both for dynamic Python (>= 1 libnrnpythonX.Y) and
# standard Python (libnrniv linked against one Python version) builds. To avoid the restrictions
# inherent in Python's limited API / stable ABI (see
# https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/stable.html#stable-application-binary-interface), we build
# Python-related NEURON code separately for each version of Python: libnrnpythonX.Y. Historically
# macOS and Linux were built ignoring the minor version, but this is unsafe without the limited API

# * NRN_PYTHON_EXECUTABLES is a list of all the Pythons that we are building against. This will only
#   have a length > 1 if NRN_ENABLE_PYTHON_DYNAMIC is defined.
