#   separated list of files in NRN_COVERAGE_FILES (relative to
#   PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR) with code coverage enabled.

#
#   NRN_COVERAGE_FILES speeds the workflow tremendously, when iteratively
#   working on a single or a few files.
#
#   Two targets are created: cover_begin and cover_html.
#
#   cover_begin erases all the *.gcda coverage files and
#   creates a baseline report (coverage-base.info)
#
#   cover_html creates a report with all coverage so far (coverage-run.info),
#   combines that with coverage_base_info to create coverage-combined.info,
#   prints a summary of the coverage-combined.info and creates an html report
#   in the html folder
#
#   All created files (folders) are relative to PROJECT_BINARY_DIR.
