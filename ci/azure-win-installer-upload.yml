# Note: silently installing neuron doesn't work, when we print out the contents of the installation folder not all files
# are there. We suspect an Azure issue since we've tried a lot of things (to name a few: trying NSIS 3.04 commit that
# was working back then, changing NSIS installers, trying latest NSIS, different process waiting strategies including
# powershell and start /wait and so on) and locally testing the installer works.
