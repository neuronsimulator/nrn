Welcome to CoreNeuron!

CoreNeuron is a neuroscience simulation software based on the popular software NEURON (www.neuron.yale.edu). 
Its goal is to simulate massive cell networks with minimal memory footprint and optimal performance. 

Please follow these instructions in order to build and run the code. 


TO BUILD:
--------

CoreNeuron is using MPI for parallelization. Currently the following compilers/MPI libraries for production
simulations are used:
- Blue Gene/Q: XLC 12.1.0.7 (V1R2M1 drivers)
- x86_64: icc 13.1, mvapich 2.0

You can use other compilers and MPI library distributions. Make sure that appropriate modules are loaded and
CMake (minimum required version 2.8) is correctly setting appropriate compilers/libraries. In order to build
the simulator follow the steps below:

1. Set the correct MPI compilers (wrappers) with the CC and CXX environment flags. 
   Example: on a Blue Gene Q:
     export CC=mpixlc
     export CXX=mpixlcxx

2. To build the binaries and libraries use the CMake build system (from the top level folder of CoreNeuron)
     mkdir build && cd build
     cmake ..
     make 

Above steps will create binaries and libraries under build/bin and build/lib folders respectively. 

If you are building standlone executable (without Neurodamus) and would like to
include all mechanisms, use command:
     cmake .. -DCORENEURON_NEURODAMUS_MECHS=ON -DCORENEURON_MAIN=ON  

By default this will build CoreNeuron with Pthread implementation. You can enable
OpenMP with -DCORENEURON_OPENMP=ON


TO INSTALL:
----------

Follow the previous steps with below modifications:

1. To CMake command line, specify the installation destination:
     cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$PATH_TO_INSTALL_FOLDER  ..

2. After building the code, install it using 
     make install

The installation folder will be $PATH_TO_INSTALL_FOLDER, and should contain (considering the dynamic libraries):

     $PATH_TO_INSTALL_FOLDER/lib/libcoreneuron.so.0.3.0
     $PATH_TO_INSTALL_FOLDER/lib/libcoreneuron.so.0.30
     $PATH_TO_INSTALL_FOLDER/lib/libcoreneuron.so
     $PATH_TO_INSTALL_FOLDER/bin/coreneuron_exec


CUSTOM BUILD:
------------

One can specify C++/C compilation flags spcecific to the compiler and architecture with -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS 
and -DCMAKE_C_FLAGS options to the CMake command:

For example, on a Blue Gene Q: 
     cmake .. -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="-O5 -qtune=qp -qarch=qp -q64 -qhot=simd -qsmp -qthreaded -qipa=level=2"
              -DCMAKE_C_FLAGS="-O5 -qtune=qp -qarch=qp -q64 -qhot=simd -qsmp -qthreaded -qipa=level=2"

Note that one should explicitly specify the compilation flags.


CMAKE CONFIGURATION:
--------------------

We have integrated the BBP CMake tree with the CoreNeuron simulator.
There are custom CMake configuration options for compilers and MPI libraries which you can find under CMake/common/oss.
Building on x86 and BG-Q platform should work with the above instructions.
On other systems (like Cray) you might need to pass additional CMake otpions like MPI_C_COMPILER, MPI_C_INCLUDE_PATH etc.

On Cray's Piz Diant system the following command line was used to build CoreNeuron:

$ export CC=`which cc` export CXX=`which CC`
$ cmake -DMPI_C_INCLUDE_PATH=$PATH_TO_MPI_C_INCLUDE_PATH -DMPI_C_LIBRARIES=$PATH_TO_MPI_C_LIBRARIES -DMPI_CXX_INCLUDE_PATH=$PATH_TO_MPI_CXX_INCLUDE_PATH -DMPI_CXX_LIBRARIES=$PATH_TO_MPI_CXX_LIBRARIES -DMPI_C_COMPILER=$CC -DMPI_CXX_COMPILER=$CXX

If you want to create static library of CoreNeuron, set corresponding option in CMakeList.txt:

SET(CORENEURON_LIBRARY_TYPE STATIC)



RUNNING SIMULATION:
------------------

Once the CoreNeuron is built, one can run parallel simulator with any MPI launcher as:
 
1. Change to the directory containing simulation input test data (bbcore_mech.dat, files.dat, *_1.dat, *_2.dat).

2. Set environmental variables by adding lib folder (in build/lib or $PATH_TO_INSTALL_FOLDER/lib) to the LD_LIBRARY_PATH :
     export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$PATH_TO_INSTALL_FOLDER/lib

3. And run simulator with any MPI launcher as:
     srun -n $NUM_MPIS $PATH_TO_CORENEURON_EXEC -mpi   (assuming slurm batch system)
     where $NUM_MPIS is number of MPI ranks and $PATH_TO_CORENEURON_EXEC is path of coreneuron executable.
 
This will run CoreNeuron with default configuration parameters. In order to see the command line options, you can use:

CORENEURON_EXEC --help

For example, you can run simulation using 10 mpi processes for 10 milliseconds using:

srun -n 10 coreneuron_exe -mpi -e 10                (note: by defualt it runs pure mpi job, add --threading to enable pthread/openmp)


RESULTS VALIDATION:
------------------

When running the simulation with CoreNeuron, each MPI rank writes spike information to out.$mpi_rank file. Those files 
should be combined, sorted and renamed to "out.dat.ref" file to further be able to follow the validation steps.

To validate the results against the reference solution, make sure to use a default simulation time used to produce a reference
results. The validation process itself is described in the "tests/validation/README" file. Please note that only double precision numbers
have been used to prepare the validation test cases.


HOW TO MODIFY TEST INPUT PARAMETERS:
-----------------------------------

1. MODIFY SIMULATION PARAMETER
Use --help command line options to list of arguments/parameters that can be passed to CoreNeuron

2. MODIFY USE CASE SIZE (Number of cells/neurons)
It is possible to run tests with different number of MPI ranks. In every simulation input data directory one can find the file named
"files.dat". This file has following format (example):

32768      -> first line is the number of cell ids (or entries) in the file
250014     -> first cell id
491530     -> second cell id
....

As shown above, first number is always the number of entries in the files and then there is a list of cell ids per line.
Once the simulation has been started, CoreNeuron will distribute the cell ids in round robin fashion. (Remeber that each cell id belongs to 
input file named cellid_1.dat and cellid_2.dat in the simulation input data directory). If threading is enabled, then each rank assigns
cell ids to threads in round robin process. Hence, it is important to select no of mpi ranks and threads so that each rank/thread get equal
no of cell ids to avoid load imbalance.

Note: Make sure that the number of MPI ranks is not greater than the number of cell ids in "files.dat". Also make sure that the number
of cell ids is not greater than the maximum number of files provided for each test case.

For example, the first line in the file "files.dat", 32768, specifies the total number of cell ids and the limitation on maximum number
of MPI for the corresponding test case (one can run simulation with less number of MPI ranks as long as all input data
fits into the memory).

To run the test on the smaller cluster, one have to modify "files.data" file accordingly. For example, if modifying first line in 
"files.dat" to 100 will result in simulator reading only 100 cell ids data (and will distribute that among all MPI ranks).
