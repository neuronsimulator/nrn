Dynamically Creating and Managing Multiple Vectors for APCount in NEURON
==========================================================================

**Question:**  
How can I efficiently create and manage multiple Vectors for recording action potential times from multiple sections or nodes in NEURON without creating many individual variable names?

**Answer:**  
Instead of dynamically generating separate variable names (e.g., timevector1, timevector2, â€¦) using string manipulation, it is more efficient and scalable to use arrays (indexed lists) or the `List` class of object references (`objref`). This approach avoids "access abuse", hard-coded magic numbers, and simplifies data management.

**Using Arrays of Vectors**  
You can define an array of `Vector` objects, one per node or section, and associate each with an `APCount` object:

.. code-block:: hoc

    // Define number of nodes
    NNODES = 20
    create node[NNODES]
    objref apc_nodes[NNODES], timevec[NNODES]

    for i=0, NNODES-1 node[i] {
        access node[i]
        apc_nodes[i] = new APCount(0.5)
        timevec[i] = new Vector()
        apc_nodes[i].record(timevec[i])
    }

**Using Lists for Dynamic Size**  
If the number of sections or recording locations may vary, or is not known in advance, use the `List` class. Lists can dynamically resize, making it easier to manage collections of objects.

.. code-block:: hoc

    objref apclist, timeveclist
    apclist = new List()
    timeveclist = new List()

    forall for (x,0) {
        objref apc, tv
        apc = new APCount(x)
        tv = new Vector()
        apc.record(tv)
        apclist.append(apc)
        timeveclist.append(tv)
    }

You can then access the vectors and APCounts by index using `.o(i)` and query the number of elements with `.count()`.

**Python Equivalent**  
In Python, you can create lists of `h.APCount` and `h.Vector` instances similarly:

.. code-block:: python

    from neuron import h

    NNODES = 20
    nodes = [h.Section(name=f'node[{i}]') for i in range(NNODES)]
    apc_nodes = []
    timevec = []

    for node in nodes:
        h.access(node)
        apc = h.APCount(0.5)
        vec = h.Vector()
        apc.record(vec)
        apc_nodes.append(apc)
        timevec.append(vec)

This method is flexible, maintains good code readability, and simplifies subsequent data handling such as saving vectors to files.

**Summary:**  
- Avoid dynamically creating variable names using string functions and `execute`.
- Use arrays (`objref name[N]`) or `List` to manage multiple Vectors and APCount objects.
- Use symbolic constants for sizes instead of magic numbers.
- Prefer Lists over arrays when the collection size changes or is unknown.
- Use `forall` and `for` loops with `access` properly to avoid "access abuse".
