Factors Influencing NEURON Simulation Run Time Beyond Total Compartment Count
==================================================================================

**Question:**  
What factors influence NEURON simulation run time beyond the total number of compartments (segments)?

**Answer:**  
While the total number of compartments (`nseg`) is a key variable that affects simulation time, other factors significantly influence the run time:

- **Number of ODEs per segment:**  
  Each segment involves solving an ODE for the cable equation plus additional ODEs corresponding to all membrane mechanisms and point processes that require integration. Examples include:
  - Distributed mechanisms declared via `SUFFIX` in NMODL.
  - Point processes like `ExpSyn` (1 ODE) or `Exp2Syn` (2 ODEs).
  - Extracellular mechanisms add extra ODEs if enabled.
  - The `rxd` module introduces ODEs per reaction-diffusion compartment.
  
- **Model morphology and branch complexity:**  
  More complex branching can affect solver efficiency and memory access patterns.

- **Cache efficiency and memory layout:**  
  How well the model fits into CPU cache and the organization of data in memory impact simulation speed. Enabling cache-efficient mode may improve performance.

**Recommendation:**  
Try enabling `cache_efficient` mode in CVode to improve performance:

.. code-block:: python

    from neuron import h
    h.cvode.cache_efficient(1)
    # Then run your simulation as usual

.. code-block:: hoc

    cvode.cache_efficient(1)
    // Then continue with simulation commands

This setting can reduce cache misses and potentially speed up simulations, especially for complex models.

By considering these factors and settings, you can better understand and optimize simulation run times in NEURON beyond just the compartment count.
