Number of Sections, Compartments, and nseg in NEURON
=====================================================

**Q: How does the number of segments (`nseg`) in a NEURON section affect simulation accuracy, and what is the relationship between sections, compartments, and `nseg`?**

- The parameter `nseg` determines the spatial discretization within a section. Increasing `nseg` improves spatial accuracy by subdividing the section into finer compartments.
- To check if `nseg` is sufficient, compare simulation results (e.g., membrane potential over time) at several positions in the model for gradually increasing `nseg`. Increase `nseg` (e.g., triple it) and rerun simulations until results no longer change significantly.
- Dividing one section of length L into multiple sections (e.g., three sections of length L/3) only increases the number of compartments if each section has `nseg=1`. Each segment within a section corresponds to one compartment; thus, a section with `nseg=3` corresponds to three compartments.
- There are guidelines such as the *d_lambda* rule to determine an appropriate `nseg` for each section based on its electrotonic length to balance accuracy and computational cost.
- Non-uniform distributions of channel densities can only be applied if `nseg > 1`, since with `nseg=1` values are uniform along the section.

Example Hoc code illustrating `nseg` and channel density settings:

.. code-block:: hoc

    create A
    access A
    A.L = 100
    A.diam = 2
    insert hh
    insert pas

    // Initially nseg = 1 (one compartment)
    print "nseg =", A.nseg   // Outputs: nseg = 1

    // Assign uniform channel density (same at all locations):
    for (x=0; x<=1; x+=0.5) {
        printf("gnabar_hh(%.1f) = %g\n", x, gnabar_hh(x))
    }

    // Increase nseg to 3 (three compartments)
    A.nseg = 3

    // Assign channel density with a gradient:
    gnabar_hh(0) = 2
    gnabar_hh(1) = 5

    // Print channel densities at segment centers:
    for (x=0; x<=1; x += 1.0/(A.nseg-1)) {
        printf("gnabar_hh(%.8f) = %g\n", x, gnabar_hh(x))
    }

Example Python code using NEURON's h module:

.. code-block:: python

    from neuron import h

    A = h.Section(name='A')
    A.L = 100
    A.diam = 2
    A.insert('hh')
    A.insert('pas')

    print(f'nseg = {A.nseg}')  # Outputs: nseg = 1

    # Access channel density values (uniform at nseg = 1)
    for x in [0, 0.5, 1]:
        print(f'gnabar_hh({x}) = {A.gnabar_hh(x)}')

    # Increase nseg to 3
    A.nseg = 3

    # Set channel density with a spatial gradient
    A.gnabar_hh[0] = 2
    A.gnabar_hh[1] = 5

    # Print channel densities at all segment locations
    for seg in A:
        print(f'gnabar_hh({seg.x}) = {seg.gnabar_hh}')

Summary:

- `nseg` controls the number of compartments within a section.
- Higher `nseg` improves accuracy but increases computational cost.
- Segment location-dependent parameters require `nseg > 1`.
- Use iterative testing or the *d_lambda* rule to set a suitable `nseg`.
