# The radian and steradian are defined as dimensionless primitive units.  
# The radian is equal to m/m and the steradian to m^2/m^2 so these units are
# dimensionless.  Retaining them as named units is useful because it allows
# clarity in expressions and makes the meaning of unit definitions more clear.
# These units will reduce to 1 in conversions but not for sums of units or for
# arguments to functions.

# Units cannot handle wind chill or heat index because they are two variable
# functions, but they are included here for your edification.  Clearly these
# equations are the result of a model fitting operation.  
#
# wind chill index (WCI) a measurement of the combined cooling effect of low
#      air temperature and wind on the human body. The index was first defined
#      by the American Antarctic explorer Paul Siple in 1939. As currently used
#      by U.S. meteorologists, the wind chill index is computed from the
#      temperature T (in °F) and wind speed V (in mi/hr) using the formula: 
#          WCI = 0.0817(3.71 sqrt(V) + 5.81 - 0.25V)(T - 91.4) + 91.4. 
#      For very low wind speeds, below 4 mi/hr, the WCI is actually higher than
#      the air temperature, but for higher wind speeds it is lower than the air
#      temperature.
# 
# heat index (HI or HX) a measure of the combined effect of heat and
#      humidity on the human body. U.S. meteorologists compute the index
#      from the temperature T (in °F) and the relative humidity H (as a
#      value from 0 to 1).
#        HI = -42.379 + 2.04901523 T + 1014.333127 H - 22.475541 TH 
#             - .00683783 T^2 - 548.1717 H^2 + 0.122874 T^2 H + 8.5282 T H^2

                        #   CGPM officially recommended the use of the
                        #   Josephson effect as a laboratory representation of
                        #   the volt.  The Josephson effect occurs when two
                        #   superconductors are separated by a thin insulating
                        #   layer.  A "supercurrent" flows across the insulator
                        #   with a frequency that depends on the potential
                        #   applied across the superconductors.  This frequency
                        #   can be very accurately measured.  The Josephson
                        #   constant K_J, which is equal to 2e/h, relates the
                        #   measured frequency to the potential.  The value
                        #   given here is the officially specified value for
                        #   use beginning in 1990.  The 1998 recommended value

R_K    25812.807 ohm    # Measurement of the ohm also presents difficulties.
                        #   The old approach involved maintaining resistances
                        #   that were subject to drift.  The new standard is
                        #   based on the Hall effect.  When a current carrying
                        #   ribbon is placed in a magnetic field, a potential
                        #   difference develops across the ribbon.  The ratio
                        #   of the potential difference to the current is
                        #   called the Hall resistance.  Klaus von Klitzing
                        #   discovered in 1980 that the Hall resistance varies
                        #   in discrete jumps when the magnetic field is very
                        #   large and the temperature very low.  This enables
                        #   accurate realization of the resistance h/e^2 in the
                        #   lab.  The value given here is the officially

# Photographic Exposure Value
#
# The Additive Photographic EXposure (APEX) system developed in Germany in
# the 1960s was an attempt to simplify exposure determination for people
# who relied on exposure tables rather than exposure meters.  Shortly
# thereafter, nearly all cameras incorporated exposure meters, so the APEX
# system never caught on, but the concept of Exposure Value (EV) given by
# 
#            A^2   LS   ES
#     2^EV = --- = -- = --
#             T    K    C
# 
# Where
#     A = Relative aperture (f-number)
#     T = Shutter time in seconds
#     L = Scene luminance in cd/m2
#     E = Scene illuminance in lux
#     S = Arithmetic ISO film speed
#     K = Reflected-light meter calibration constant
#     C = Incident-light meter calibration constant
# 
# remains in use.  Strictly speaking, an Exposure Value is a combination
# of aperture and shutter time, but it's also commonly used to indicate
# luminance (or illuminance).  Conversion to luminance or illuminance
# units depends on the ISO film speed and the meter calibration constant.
# Common practice is to use an ISO film speed of 100 (because film speeds
# are in even 1/3-step increments, the exact value is 64 * 2^(2|3)).
# Calibration constants vary among camera and meter manufacturers: Canon,
# Nikon, and Sekonic use a value of 12.5 for reflected-light meters, while
# Minolta and Pentax use a value of 14.  Minolta and Sekonic use a value
# of 250 for incident-light meters with flat receptors.

# Astronomical time measurements
#
# Astronmical time measurement is a complicated matter.  The length of the true
# day at a given place can be 21 seconds less than 24 hours or 30 seconds over
# 24 hours.  The two main reasons for this are the varying speed of the earth
# in its elliptical orbit and the fact that the sun moves on the ecliptic
# instead of along the celestial equator.  To devise a workable system for time
# measurement, Simon Newcomb (1835-1909) used a fictitious "mean sun".
# Consider a first fictitious sun traveling along the ecliptic at a constant
# speed and coinciding with the true sun at perigee and apogee.  Then
# considering a second fictitious sun traveling along the celestial equator at
# a constant speed and coninciding with the first fictitious sun at the
# equinoxes.  The second fictitious sun is the "mean sun".  From this equations
# can be written out to determine the length of the mean day, and the tropical
# year.  The length of the second was determined based on the tropical year
# from such a calculation and was officially used from 1960-1967 until atomic
# clocks replaced astronomical measurements for a standard of time.  All of the
# values below give the mean time for the specified interval.  
#
# See "Mathematical Astronomy Morsels" by Jean Meeus for more details
# an a description of how to compute the correction to mean time.

# Many astronomical values can be measured most accurately in a system of units
# using the astronomical unit and the mass of the sun as base units.  The
# uncertainty in the gravitational constant makes conversion to SI units
# significantly less accurate.

# The astronomical unit was defined to be the length of the of the semimajor
# axis of a massless object with the same year as the earth.  With such a
# definition in force, and with the mass of the sun set equal to one, Kepler's
# third law can be used to solve for the value of the gravitational constant.

# Kepler's third law says that (2 pi / T)^2 a^3 = G M where T is the orbital
# period, a is the size of the semimajor axis, G is the gravitational constant
# and M is the mass.  The Gaussian gravitational constant is the sqrt(G) in
# with M = 1 we find sqrt(G) = (2 pi / T) sqrt(AU^3).  This constant is called
# the Gaussian gravitational constant, apparently because Gauss originally did
# the calculations.  However, when the original calculation was done, the value
# for the length of the earth's year was inaccurate.  The value used is called
# the Gaussian year.  Changing the astronomical unit to bring it into agreement
# with more accurate values for the year would have invalidated a lot of
# previous work, so instead the astronomical unit has been kept equal to this
# original value.  This is accomplished by using a standard value for the
# Gaussian gravitational constant.  This constant is called k.

# The US Metric Law of 1866 legalized the metric system in the USA and defined
# the meter in terms of the British system with the exact 1 meter = 39.37
# inches.  On April 5, 1893 Corwin Mendenhall decided, in what has become known
# as the "Mendenhall Order" that the meter and kilogram would be the
# fundamental standards in the USA.  The definition from 1866 was turned around
# to give an exact definition of the foot as 1200|3937 meters.  This definition
# was used until July of 1959 when the definition was changed to bring the US
# into agreement with other countries.  Since 1959, the foot has been exactly
# 0.3048 meters.  At the same time it was decided that any data expressed in
# feet derived from geodetic surveys within the US would continue to use the
# old definition and call the old unit the "survey foot".

# British

# The length measure in the UK was defined by a bronze bar manufactured in
# 1844.  Various conversions were sanctioned for convenience at different
# times, which makes conversions before 1963 a confusing matter.  Apparently
# previous conversions were never explicitly revoked.  Four different
# conversion factors appear below.  Multiply them times an imperial length
# units as desired.  unit.  The Weights and Measures Act of 1963 switched the
# UK away from their bronze standard and onto a definition of the yard in terms
# of the meter.  This happened after an international agreement in 1959 to
# align the world's measurement systems.

# Density measures.  Density has traditionally been measured on a variety of
# bizarre nonlinear scales.  
#

# Density of a sugar syrup is frequently measured in candy making procedures.
# In the USA the boiling point of the syrup is measured.  Some recipes instead
# specify the density using degrees Baume.  Conversion between degrees Baume
# and the boiling point measure has proved elusive.  One food science text
# claimed that the boiling point elevation formula could be used.  This formula
# gives the elevation  1000 (.512) x / (100-x) 342.3 for sucrose.  However, 
# it disagrees significantly with a table that appeared in another text
# which gave the table below.  However, this table cannot be converted reliably
# to a density measure because the brix table stops at 80% concentration.

# Degrees Baume is used in European recipes to specify the density of a sugar
# syrup.  An entirely different definition is used for densities below 
# 1 g/cm^3.  An arbitrary constant appears in the definition.  This value is
# equal to 145 in the US, but was according to [], the old scale used in
# Holland had a value of 144, and the new scale or Gerlach scale used 146.78.

# gsm (Grams per Square Meter), a sane, metric paper weight measure

gsm                     grams / meter^2

# In the USA, a collection of crazy historical paper measures are used.  Paper
# is measured as a weight of a ream of that particular type of paper.  This is
# sometimes called the "substance" or "basis" (as in "substance 20" paper).
# The standard sheet size or "basis size" varies depending on the type of
# paper.  As a result, 20 pound bond paper and 50 pound text paper are actually
# about the same weight.  The different sheet sizes were historically the most
# convenient for printing or folding in the different applications.  These
# different basis weights are standards maintained by American Society for
# Testing Materials (ASTM) and the American Forest and Paper Association
# (AF&PA).

# Wire Gauge 
#
# This area is a nightmare with huge charts of wire gauge diameters
# that usually have no clear origin.  There are at least 5 competing wire gauge
# systems to add to the confusion.  The use of wire gauge is related to the
# manufacturing method: a metal rod is heated and drawn through a hole.  The
# size change can't be too big.  To get smaller wires, the process is repeated
# with a series of smaller holes.  Generally larger gauges mean smaller wires.
# The gauges often have values such as "00" and "000" which are larger sizes
# than simply "0" gauge.  In the tables that appear below, these gauges must be
# specified as negative numbers (e.g. "00" is -1, "000" is -2, etc).
# Alternatively, you can use the following units:
#

g00                      (-1)
g000                     (-2)
g0000                    (-3)
g00000                   (-4)

g0000000                 (-6)

# American Wire Gauge (AWG) or Brown & Sharpe Gauge appears to be the most
# important gauge. ASTM B-258 specifies that this gauge is based on geometric
# interpolation between gauge 0000, which is 0.46 inches exactly, and gauge 36
# which is 0.005 inches exactly.  Therefore, the diameter in inches of a wire
# is given by the formula 1|200 92^((36-g)/39).  Note that 92^(1/39) is close
# to 2^(1/6), so diameter is approximately halved for every 6 gauges.  For the
# repeated zero values, use negative numbers in the formula.  The same document
# also specifies rounding rules which seem to be ignored by makers of tables.
# Gauges up to 44 are to be specified with up to 4 significant figures, but no
# closer than 0.0001 inch.  Gauges from 44 to 56 are to be rounded to the
# nearest 0.00001 inch.  
#
# In addition to being used to measure wire thickness, this gauge is used to
# measure the thickness of sheets of aluminum, copper, and most metals other
# than steel, iron and zinc.

# The following is from the Appendix to ASTM B 258
#
#    For example, in U.S. gage, the standard for sheet metal is based on the
#    weight of the metal, not on the thickness. 16-gage is listed as
#    approximately .0625 inch thick and 40 ounces per square foot (the original
#    standard was based on wrought iron at .2778 pounds per cubic inch; steel
#    has almost entirely superseded wrought iron for sheet use, at .2833 pounds
#    per cubic inch). Smaller numbers refer to greater thickness. There is no
#    formula for converting gage to thickness or weight.
# 
# It's rather unclear from the passage above whether the plate gauge values are
# therefore wrong if steel is being used.  Reference [15] states that steel is
# in fact measured using this gauge (under the name Manufacturers' Standard
# Gauge) with a density of 501.84 lb/ft3 = 0.2904 lb/in3 used for steel.
# But this doesn't seem to be the correct density of steel (.2833 lb/in3 is
# closer).  
#
# This gauge was established in 1893 for purposes of taxation.

# Ring size. All ring sizes are given as the circumference of the ring.
#

# USA ring sizes.  Several slightly different definitions seem to be in
# circulation.  According to [15], the interior diameter of size n ring in
# inches is 0.32 n + 0.458 for n ranging from 3 to 13.5 by steps of 0.5.  The
# size 2 ring is inconsistently 0.538in and no 2.5 size is listed.  
#
# However, other sources list 0.455 + 0.0326 n and 0.4525 + 0.0324 n as the
# diameter and list no special case for size 2.  (Or alternatively they are
# 1.43 + .102 n and 1.4216+.1018 n for measuring circumference in inches.)  One
# reference claimed that the original system was that each size was 1|10 inch
# circumference, but that source doesn't have an explanation for the modern
# system which is somewhat different.

# Old practice in the UK measured rings using the "Wheatsheaf gauge" with sizes
# specified alphabetically and based on the ring inside diameter in steps of
# 1|64 inch.  This system was replaced in 1987 by British Standard 6820 which
# specifies sizes based on circumference.  Each size is 1.25 mm different from
# the preceding size.  The baseline is size C which is 40 mm circumference.
# The new sizes are close to the old ones.  Sometimes it's necessary to go
# beyond size Z to Z+1, Z+2, etc.

# Atomic weights.  The atomic weight of an element is the ratio of the mass of
# a mole of the element to 1|12 of a mole of Carbon 12.  The Standard Atomic
# Weights apply to the elements as they occur naturally on earth.  Elements
# which do not occur naturally or which occur with wide isotopic variability do
# not have Standard Atomic Weights.  For these elements, the atomic weight is
# based on the longest lived isotope, as marked in the comments.  In some
# cases, the comment for these entries also gives a number which is an atomic
# weight for a different isotope that may be of more interest than the longest
# lived isotope.

# Traditional Japanese units (shakkanhou)
#
# The traditional system of weights and measures is called shakkanhou from the
# shaku and the ken.  Japan accepted SI units in 1891 and legalized conversions
# to the traditional system.  In 1909 the inch-pound system was also legalized,
# so Japan had three legally approved systems.  A change to the metric system
# started in 1921 but there was a lot of resistance.  The Measurement Law of
# October 1999 prohibits sales in anything but SI units.  However, the old
# units still live on in construction and as the basis for paper sizes of books
# and tools used for handicrafts.  
#
# Note that units below use the Hepburn romanization system.  Some other
# systems would render "mou", "jou", and "chou" as "mo", "jo" and "cho".

# Japanese Length Measures

#                 Omitted because there are no other units for this
#                 dimension.  Is this true?  What about CCS = 1/36 erlang?
#                 Erlang is supposed to be dimensionless.  One erlang means
#                 a single channel occupied for one hour.
