How do I compile mod files?
--------------------------

If the folder with your NEURON scripts (HOC or Python) is the same as the folder with the mod files, open it in a terminal and type ``nrnivmodl``. You can also specify paths; e.g. if all the mod files are in a subfolder called ``mod`` but you're running NEURON from the current folder, type ``nrnivmodl mod``.

Windows and Mac also provide graphical tools that can be used to compile mod files.
