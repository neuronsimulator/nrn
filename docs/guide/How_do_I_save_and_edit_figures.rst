How do I save and edit figures?
-------------------------------

The quick and dirty way is to capture screen images as bitmaps. The results are suitable for posting on WWW sites but resolution is generally too low for publication or grant proposals, and editing is a pain. For highest quality, PostScript is best. Use the Print & File Window Manager (PFWM) to save the graphs you want to an Idraw file. This is an encapsulated PostScript format that can be edited by idraw, which comes with the UNIX/Linux version of NEURON. It can also be imported by many draw programs, e.g. CorelDraw.
