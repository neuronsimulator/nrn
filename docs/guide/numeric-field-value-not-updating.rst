.. _numeric-field-value-not-updating:

When I type a new value into a numeric field, it doesn't seem to have any effect.

You seem to be using a very old version of NEURON. If you can't update to the most recent version, try this:

After entering a new value, be sure to click on the button next to the numeric field (or press the Return key) so that the bright yellow warning indicator on the button is turned off. While the yellow indicator is showing, the field editor is still in entry mode and its contents have not yet been assigned to the proper variable in memory.
