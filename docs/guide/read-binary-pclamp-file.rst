How can I read data from a binary PClamp file?
----------------------------------------------

clampex.zip contains a mod file that defines an object class (ClampExData) whose methods can read PClamp binary files â€” or at least it could several years ago - plus a sample data file and a hoc file to illustrate usage. If ClampExData doesn't work with the most recent PClamp file formats, at least ``clampex.mod`` is a starting point that you can modify as needed.
