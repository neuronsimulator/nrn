Is there a list of functions that are built into NEURON?
--------------------------------------------------------

For available functions when scripting or interactively using NEURON, see the `Python programmer's reference <../python/index.html>`_ or the `HOC programmer's reference <../hoc/index.html>`_ as appropriate. (Standard Python functions and libraries may be used as well.)

For functions available when defining ion channel mechanisms etc with NMODL, see :ref:`here <nmodls_built_in_functions>`.
