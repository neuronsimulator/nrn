    "### NMODL SympySolver - cnexp\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook describes the implementation of the `cnexp` part of the `SympySolverVisitor`, which solves the systems of ODEs defined in `DERIVATIVE` blocks when these ODEs are *linear* and *independent*.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a higher level overview of the approach to solving ODEs in NMODL, please see the [nmodl-odes-overview](nmodl-odes-overview.ipynb) notebook. \n",
    "\n",
    "For a more general tutorial on using the NMODL python interface, please see the [tutorial notebook](nmodl-python-tutorial.ipynb).\n",
    "***\n",
    "#### Implementation\n",
    "The `SympySolverVisitor` for solver method `cnexp` does the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Get list of all global scope variables from the Symbol Table, as well as any local variables in DERIVATIVE block\n",
    "* For each differential equation in DERIVATIVE block:\n",
    "    * Parse equation into SymPy, giving it the list of variables\n",
    "    * This gives us a differential equation of the form:\n",
    "        * $\\frac{dm}{dt} = f(m, \\dots)$\n",
    "        * where the function $f$ depends on $m$, as well as possibly other variables reprensented by $\\dots$ which we assume do not depend on $m$ or $t$\n",
    "    * Solve equation analytically using [sympy.dsolve](https://docs.sympy.org/latest/modules/solvers/ode.html) to give a solution of the form:\n",
    "        * $m(t+dt) = g(m(t), dt, \\dots)$\n",
    "        * where $g$ is some function that depends on the value of $m$ at time t, the timestep $dt$, and the other variables ($\\dots$).\n",
    "    * Replace ODE with analytic solution as C code using [sympy.printing.ccode](https://docs.sympy.org/latest/_modules/sympy/printing/ccode.html)\n",
    "    * If we fail to find a solution then do nothing - so currently NMODL reverts to using the legacy CNEXP solver routine (same as mod2c or nocmodl)\n",
    "***\n",
    "#### Pade approximant\n",
    "There is an option `use_pade_approx` which if enabled does the following extra step:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Given the analytic solution $f(t)$:\n",
    "    * Expand the solution in a Taylor series in `dt`, extract the coefficients $a_i$\n",
    "        * $f(t + dt) = f(t) + dt f'(t) + dt^2 f''(t) / 2 + \\dots = a_0 + a_1 dt + a_2 dt^2 + \\dots$\n",
    "    * Construct the (1,1) Pade approximant to the solution using these Taylor coefficients\n",
    "        * $f_{PADE}(t+dt) = (a_0 a_1 + (a_1^2 - a_0 a_2) dt)/(a_1 - a_2 dt)$\n",
    "    * Return this approximate solution (correct to second order in $dt$) as C code\n",
    "\n",
    "(Replacing the exponential with a Pade aproximant here was suggested in sec 5.2 of (https://www.eccomas2016.org/proceedings/pdf/7366.pdf) - since the overall numerical integration scheme in NEURON is only correct to first or second order in $dt$, it is valid to expand the analytic solution here to the same order and so avoid evaluating the exponential function)\n",
    "***\n",
    "#### Implementation Tests\n",
    "The unit tests may be helpful to understand what these functions are doing\n",
    "  - `SympySolverVisitor` tests are located in [test/visitor/sympy_solver.cpp](https://github.com/BlueBrain/nmodl/blob/master/test/visitor/sympy_solver.cpp), and tests involving `cnexp` have the tag \"`[cnexp]`\""
