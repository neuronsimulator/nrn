    "## Overview\n",
    "<p>In every cell type, intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling plays a major role in a diverse set of activities, including process homeostasis and genetic expression. In neurons, Ca<sup>2+</sup> wave propagation has been implicated as a major component of intracellular signaling and is complementary to membrane electrical signaling via action potentials. It follows that the cell must contain tightly-controlled intrinsic mechanisms for regulating intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> content and waves; these include cytosolic buffers, storage in the ER, and sequestration into mitochondria. In this tutorial, we examine how some of these basic mechanisms interact to produce a Ca<sup>2+</sup> wave.</p>"

    "## Concept\n",
    "<p>Ca<sup>2+</sup> is well-buffered by several cytosolic proteins (e.g. calmodulin, calbindin, etc...), but must still traverse a significant distance within the neuron to reach its targets. This distance is long enough that pure diffusion would pose a temporal problem for cell communication. Instead, the cell uses oscillating Ca<sup>2+</sup> waves to harness the power of chemical signaling. These waves can travel up and down the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) to effect homeostatic changes. Understanding how these waves are modulated in real time by the cell poses a great difficulty because of complex spatiotemporal patterns and nonuniform distribution of the channels that control Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux across the ER. Inositol triphosphate (IP<sub>3</sub>) receptors IP<sub>3</sub>Rs), Sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase (SERCA pump), and Ryanoine receptors (RyRs). For simplicity’s sake, we will not deal with RyRs in this tutorial.</p><p>\n",
    "Diffusible Ca<sup>2+</sup> is released directly from the ER via IP<sub>3</sub>Rs upon cooperative binding of free Ca<sup>2+</sup> and IP<sub>3</sub> to the receptor. When IP<sub>3</sub> levels are ideal, this results in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> release (CICR), yielding a wave that can travel along the ER. As mentioned above, these waves are implicated in the gene expression and protein upregulation associated with neuronal plasticity by way of their interaction with the neuronal soma. The SERCA pumps within ER are normally responsible for maintaining appropriate intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels. Two models exist for wave propagation: continuous and saltatory. To understand the physical and functional differences between these models, it is ideal to compare them using Reaction-Diffusion (RxD) wtihin the NEURON environment.\n",
    "</p><p>\n",
    "The model presented in this tutorial generates Ca<sup>2+</sup> waves and is based loosely off of the <a href=\"//modeldb.science/168874\">model</a> we used in <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1162/NECO_a_00712\">Neymotin et al., 2015</a>.</p>"
