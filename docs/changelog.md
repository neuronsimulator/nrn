# NEURON 9.0

## NEURON 9.0.0
_Release Date_ : 24-12-2024

NEURON 9.0 marks a major milestone with significant under-the-hood updates.
This release features a redesign of internal data structures using the
Structure-Of-Arrays (SoA) memory layout, migration of the codebase and translation
of MOD files to C++, and the introduction of random number generator construct natively
in the NMODL language. Additionally, many legacy NMODL constructs have been removed,
and legacy code and libraries have been replaced with modern alternatives
like Eigen, ensuring improved performance and maintainability. DataHandles (pointers) into
the SoA memory layout are valid (point to the correct value) regardless of how memory is
internally reorganized or reallocated for purposes of higher simulation performance. 

### Whatâ€™s New

- Use of SoA memory layout for internal data structures and DataHandles instead of pointers into that memory. ([#2027](https://github.com/neuronsimulator/nrn/issues/2027), [#2381](https://github.com/neuronsimulator/nrn/issues/2381), [#2712](https://github.com/neuronsimulator/nrn/issues/2712))
- Support for random number generator language construct (RANDOM) in NMODL ([#2627](https://github.com/neuronsimulator/nrn/issues/2627))
- Replace pthread-based threading implementation with std::thread ([#1859](https://github.com/neuronsimulator/nrn/issues/1859))
- Introduce meaningful Python types: HOC classes associated with Python types ([#1858](https://github.com/neuronsimulator/nrn/issues/1858))
- Formalization of C API for NEURON (first version) ([#2357](https://github.com/neuronsimulator/nrn/issues/2357))
- Introduce nanobind to gradually replace C Python API usage ([#2545](https://github.com/neuronsimulator/nrn/issues/2545))
- Requires C++17 compiler and flex >= 2.6 ([#1893](https://github.com/neuronsimulator/nrn/issues/1893))
- CoreNEURON repository is merged into NEURON ([#2055](https://github.com/neuronsimulator/nrn/issues/2055))
- Support for `numpy>=2` added ([#3040](https://github.com/neuronsimulator/nrn/issues/3040))
- Replace legacy Meschach source copy with Eigen library ([#2470](https://github.com/neuronsimulator/nrn/issues/2470))

### Breaking Changes

- MOD files are compiled as C++ instead of C (see [migration guide](guide/porting_mechanisms_to_cpp.rst#porting-mechanisms-to-cpp) for VERBATIM blocks)
- API changes in the functions related to random numbers, see [#2618](https://github.com/neuronsimulator/nrn/issues/2618)
- Restored usage of TABLE statement in hh.mod, results are now same as 8.0.2 (see [#1764](https://github.com/neuronsimulator/nrn/issues/1764))
- NMODL: Disallow use of ion variable in the CONSTANT block ([#1955](https://github.com/neuronsimulator/nrn/issues/1955))
- NMODL: Disallow declaring variables and functions with the same name ([#1992](https://github.com/neuronsimulator/nrn/issues/1992))
- Usage of Eigen library could introduce floating point differences, but they are very small, validated and can be ignored

## 8.2.0
_Release Date_ : 01-07-2022

### What's New
* Allow multiple BEFORE/AFTER blocks of same type in a MOD file. #1722
* Several documentation updates, including randomness in NEURON models #1727,
  NEURON course exercise sets from 2018 #1735 and publications using NEURON #1819.
* CMake: improved documentation targets. (#1725)

### Breaking Changes
* Support for Python 3.6 was dropped, as it has reached end-of-life (#1733).
* In this release, more declarations of NEURON methods (typically `nrn_` and
  `hoc_` functions) are implicitly included in translated MOD files. This can
  cause compilation errors with MOD files that include incorrect declarations
  of these methods in `VERBATIM` blocks. (#1755, #1811, #1825).
* Declaring STATE variables as GLOBAL is now disallowed. (#1723)

### Deprecations & future changes
* NEURON is in the process of being fully migrated to a `C++` codebase.
  Starting with next major release `9.0.0`, `MOD` files will be converted to `C++` instead of `C`.
  This will break compatibility with some legacy MOD files containing VERBATIM blocks and code may have to be updated
  given that some valid C code is not valid C++.
  A migration [guide](https://github.com/neuronsimulator/nrn/blob/80778700048f3aeefd35477308151bf7dd118941/docs/guide/porting_mechanisms_to_cpp.rst)
  is being compiled in the latest online documentation (note that it may change post release).
* `Random123` will be the default random number generator in NEURON and most of the random number distributions implementations will be
  replaced by those in the C++ standard library, while a few will be discontinued. See  [#1330](https://github.com/neuronsimulator/nrn/issues/1330) for follow-up and questions.

### Bug Fixes
* Fix for #335: Return proper exit code in hoc execution #1633
* Build on Ubuntu21.10 WSL: escape special characters (#1862)

### Improvements /  Other Changes
* Support for using `mallinfo2()` (#1805)
* HOC domain for Sphinx `5.0.1`

### Upgrade Steps
* If your MOD files contain VERBATIM blocks you may need to refer to the aforementioned
  [C++ migration guide](https://github.com/neuronsimulator/nrn/blob/80778700048f3aeefd35477308151bf7dd118941/docs/guide/porting_mechanisms_to_cpp.rst)
  and make minor changes to prepare for the upcoming `9.0.0` release.
  Remaining compatible with `8.2.0` and older versions is typically straightforward.

  We will update the NEURON documentation describing how one can make MOD files compatible with this change.
* Python 3.6 Is End-of-Life - drop support after 8.1 release (#1651)

- [nrn-build-ci](https://github.com/neuronsimulator/nrn-build-ci) repository test nightly builds for Ubuntu 18.04, Ubuntu 20.04, Fedora 32, Fedora 33, CentOS7, CentOS8, Debian Buster (10) and macOS 10.15 platforms.
- Improved integration of CoreNEURON
- Support for recent numpy version
- Various build improvements on Linux, MacOS and HPC platforms
- Documentation from various repositories is consolidated under `nrn` repository
- New releases via Spack and Easybuild package managers
- Fix deadlock when compiling NEURON with AVX-512
- Add backward-cpp for better backtraces
- NEURON_MODULE_OPTIONS environment variable to pass in nrniv options before `neuron import`

### Upgrade Steps

Existing models should work without any changes.  In order to upgrade NEURON version you can:
- Use python wheels provided for Linux or Mac OS platform
- Use binary installer provided for windows
- Install from source, preferably using CMake build system
- For new version, it's always a good idea to start over from scratch with nrnivmodl (deleting existing directory like `x86_64`)

See `Installation` section under [nrn.readthedocs.io/](nrn.readthedocs.io/). In the very rare case that numerical differences exist, check selection of legacy vs modern units.
