## 8.2.0
_Release Date_ : 01-07-2022

### What's New
* Allow multiple BEFORE/AFTER blocks of same type in a MOD file. #1722
* Several documentation updates, including randomness in NEURON models #1727,
  NEURON course exercise sets from 2018 #1735 and publications using NEURON #1819.
* CMake: improved documentation targets. (#1725)

### Breaking Changes
* Support for Python 3.6 was dropped, as it has reached end-of-life (#1733).
* In this release, more declarations of NEURON methods (typically `nrn_` and
  `hoc_` functions) are implicitly included in translated MOD files. This can
  cause compilation errors with MOD files that include incorrect declarations
  of these methods in `VERBATIM` blocks. (#1755, #1811, #1825).
* Declaring STATE variables as GLOBAL is now disallowed. (#1723)

### Deprecations & future changes
* NEURON is in the process of being fully migrated to a `C++` codebase.
  Starting with next major release `9.0.0`, `MOD` files will be converted to `C++` instead of `C`.
  This will break compatibility with some legacy MOD files containing VERBATIM blocks and code may have to be updated
  given that some valid C code is not valid C++.
  A migration [guide](https://github.com/neuronsimulator/nrn/blob/80778700048f3aeefd35477308151bf7dd118941/docs/guide/porting_mechanisms_to_cpp.rst)
  is being compiled in the latest online documentation (note that it may change post release).
* `Random123` will be the default random number generator in NEURON and most of the random number distributions implementations will be
  replaced by those in the C++ standard library, while a few will be discontinued. See  [#1330](https://github.com/neuronsimulator/nrn/issues/1330) for follow-up and questions.

### Bug Fixes
* Fix for #335: Return proper exit code in hoc execution #1633
* Build on Ubuntu21.10 WSL: escape special characters (#1862)

### Improvements /  Other Changes
* Support for using `mallinfo2()` (#1805)
* HOC domain for Sphinx `5.0.1`

### Upgrade Steps
* If your MOD files contain VERBATIM blocks you may need to refer to the aforementioned
  [C++ migration guide](https://github.com/neuronsimulator/nrn/blob/80778700048f3aeefd35477308151bf7dd118941/docs/guide/porting_mechanisms_to_cpp.rst)
  and make minor changes to prepare for the upcoming `9.0.0` release.
  Remaining compatible with `8.2.0` and older versions is typically straightforward.

### Deprecations

  This might break compatibility with some legacy MOD files containing `VERBATIM` blocks.
  We will update the NEURON documentation describing how one can make MOD files compatible with this change.
* Python 3.6 Is End-of-Life - drop support after 8.1 release (#1651)

## 8.0.2
_Release Date_ : 02-02-2022


### Bug Fixes

Python 3.10 bugfixes for RXD and Windows, more details in [GitHub PR #1614](https://github.com/neuronsimulator/nrn/pull/1614)

_Release Date_ : 28-01-2022


### What's New

- Python 3.10 support & wheels

### Bug Fixes

For the complete list of bug fixes, see the list in [GitHub PR #1603](https://github.com/neuronsimulator/nrn/pull/1603)

### Improvements /  Other Changes

- Introduce a Sphinx HOC domain for NEURON documentation


## 8.0.0
_Release Date_ : 30-04-2021


### What's New

- Dynamic selection of legacy vs modern units using HOC/Python API (**default** : modern)
- Faster reaction-diffusion support
- Initial GPU support using integration of CoreNEURON
- Binary installer for new Apple M1 platform
- Binary wheel distribution for Python 3.9 and Python 2.7
- Release of NMODL version 0.3 (available as python wheel)
- Versioned documentation available via [nrn.readthedocs.io](https://nrn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- CMake as a primary build system for NEURON and Interviews


### Breaking Changes
- `h.Section` now interprets positional arguments as `name`, `cell`. Previously positional arguments were interpreted in the other order. (Calling it with keyword arguments is unchanged.)
-  For 3d reaction-diffusion simulations, the voxelization and segment mapping algorithms have been adjusted, especially around the soma. Voxel indices and sometimes counts will change from previous versions.

### Deprecations
- Five functions in the `neuron` module: `neuron.init`, `neuron.run`, `neuron.psection`, `neuron.xopen`, and `neuron.quit`.
- Autotools build is deprecated and will be removed in the next release. Use CMake instead.
- Python 2 and Python 3.5 support  is deprecated and will be removed in the next release. Use `Python >= 3.6`

### Bug Fixes

For the complete list of bug fixes, see the list on the [GitHub here](https://github.com/neuronsimulator/nrn/issues/1211#issuecomment-826919173).

### Improvements /  Other Changes
- Allow for two point (single section) SWC somas
- GitHub Actions and Azure as primary CI systems. Travis CI removed.
- GitHub [Releases](https://github.com/neuronsimulator/nrn/releases) provides full source tarballs, binary installers and python wheels.
- Improved testing and CI infrastructure including GPUs
- [nrn-build-ci](https://github.com/neuronsimulator/nrn-build-ci) repository test nightly builds for Ubuntu 18.04, Ubuntu 20.04, Fedora 32, Fedora 33, CentOS7, CentOS8, Debian Buster (10) and macOS 10.15 platforms.
- Improved integration of CoreNEURON
- Support for recent numpy version
- Various build improvements on Linux, MacOS and HPC platforms
- Documentation from various repositories is consolidated under `nrn` repository
- New releases via Spack and Easybuild package managers
- Fix deadlock when compiling NEURON with AVX-512
- Add backward-cpp for better backtraces
- NEURON_MODULE_OPTIONS environment variable to pass in nrniv options before `neuron import`

### Upgrade Steps

Existing models should work without any changes.  In order to upgrade NEURON version you can:
- Use python wheels provided for Linux or Mac OS platform
- Use binary installer provided for windows
- Install from source, preferably using CMake build system
- For new version, it's always a good idea to start over from scratch with nrnivmodl (deleting existing directory like `x86_64`)

See `Installation` section under [nrn.readthedocs.io/](nrn.readthedocs.io/). In the very rare case that numerical differences exist, check selection of legacy vs modern units.
