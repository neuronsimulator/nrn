.. class:: Deck


    Syntax:
        ``h.Deck()``


    Description:
        A special kind of box which is like a card deck in which only one card 
        is shown at a time. Cards are indexed according to the order of the 
        intercepted windows (0 is the first card). 
         

    Example:

        .. code-block::
            python
        
            from neuron import h, gui
            from math import sin, cos

            deck = h.Deck()
            deck.intercept(True)      # all following windows will be placed in the deck
            ncard = 10                # there will be 10 cards in the deck

            def mkgraph(n):
                """make a new graph"""
                g = h.Graph()          # the new graph is declared
                g.size(-4, 4, -4, 4)   # and given a size
                g.begin()
                for i in range(629):
                    t = 0.01 * i
                    g.line(3 * cos(t), 3 * sin(n * t))
                g.flush()              # draw the plot

            def flip_function(i):
                """return a function that flips to the ith card"""
                return lambda: deck.flip_to(i)

            mkgraph(1)                 # make the first graph, so it will appear while the other
            deck.intercept(False)      # 9 graphs are being made
            deck.map()                 # put the deck on the screen
            deck.flip_to(0)            # show the first plot of the deck
            h.xpanel('flip to')        # create a panel titled "flip to"
            for i in range(ncard):     # create radio buttons which will bring each card to the front
                h.xradiobutton('card %d' % (i + 1), flip_function(i), i == 0)

            h.xpanel()                 # close off the set of panel commands

            for i in range(1, ncard):  # now that the first card appears on the screen, make the rest
                deck.intercept(True)   # reopen the deck
                mkgraph(i + 1)         # make a plot for each other card
                deck.intercept(0)      # close the deck


        .. image:: ../../images/deck-constructor.png
            :align: center
         
        makes a deck of windows showing the plots :math:`\{(3\cos(t), 3\sin(i\,t)): 0 \le t \le 2\pi \}`, where :math:`i=1 \ldots 10`.
        You can see in this example how the 
        panel of radio buttons enhances your ability 
        to access a particular plot. 

         

----



.. method:: Deck.intercept


    Syntax:
        ``.intercept(True or False)``


    Description:
        When the argument is True (or 1), all window creation is intercepted and the window 
        contents are placed in a deck rather than independently on the screen. 
         

----



.. method:: Deck.map


    Syntax:
        ``.map("label")``

        ``.map("label", left, top, width, height)``


    Description:
        Make a window out of the deck. *Left* and *top* specify placement with 
        respect to screen pixel coordinates where 0,0 is the top left. 
        *Width* and *height* are ignored (the size of the window is the sum 
        of the components) 

    Example:

        .. code-block::
            python

            from neuron import h, gui
            
            d = h.Deck() 
            d.map()		# actually draws the deck window on the screen 

        creates an empty deck window on the screen. 

    .. warning::
        The labeling argument does not produce a title for a deck under Microsoft Windows. 

         

----



.. method:: Deck.unmap


    Syntax:
        ``.unmap()``


    Description:
        Dismiss the last mapped window depicting this deck. This 
        is called automatically when the last hoc object variable 
        reference 
        to the deck is destroyed. 

         

----



.. method:: Deck.save


    Syntax:
        ``.save("procedure_name")``


    Description:
        Execute the procedure when the deck is saved. 
        By default 
        a deck is saved by recursively saving its items which is almost 
        always the wrong thing to do since the semantic connections between 
        the items are lost. 

         

----



.. method:: Deck.flip_to


    Syntax:
        ``.flip_to(i)``


    Description:
        Flip to the i'th card (window) in the deck. (-1 means no card is shown) 

         

----



.. method:: Deck.remove_last


    Syntax:
        ``.remove_last()``


    Description:
        Delete the last card in the deck. 

         

----



.. method:: Deck.move_last


    Syntax:
        ``.move_last(i)``


    Description:
        Moves the last card in the deck so that it is the i'th card 
        in the deck. 

         

----



.. method:: Deck.remove


    Syntax:
        ``.remove(i)``


    Description:
        Delete the i'th card in the deck. 

         
----         



.. class:: HBox


    .. seealso::
        :class:`VBox`


----


.. class:: VBox


    Syntax:
        ``h.HBox()``

        ``h.HBox(frame)``

        ``h.VBox()``

        ``h.VBox(frame)``

        ``h.VBox(frame, 0or1)``


    Description:
        A box usually organizes a collection of graphs and command panels, which 
        would normally take up several windows, into 
        a single window.  Anything which can have its own window can be contained 
        in a box. 
         
        As with all classes, a box must have an object reference pointer, and 
        can be manipulated through this pointer.  You must use the \ ``.map`` 
        command to make a box appear on the screen. 
         
        A VBox with a second arg of 1 makes a vertical scrollbox. 
         
        \ ``HBox()`` tiles windows horizontally. 
         
        \ ``VBox()`` tiles windows vertically. 
         
        The default frame is an inset frame. The available frames are: 


        0 
            inset (gray) 

        1 
            outset (gray) 

        2 
            bright inset (light gray) 

        3 
            none (sea green) 


    Example:

        .. code-block::
            python

            from neuron import h, gui
            b = h.VBox(2)
            b.map()

        creates an empty box on the screen with a light gray inset frame. 

         

----



.. method:: VBox.intercept


    Syntax:
        ``box.intercept(True)``

        ``box.intercept(False)``


    Description:
        When the argument is True (or 1), all window creation is intercepted and the window 
        contents are placed in a box rather than independently on the screen. 

    Example:

        .. code-block::
            python
            
            from neuron import h, gui

            vbox = h.VBox()
            vbox.intercept(True)	# all following creations go into the "vbox" box 
            g = h.Graph() 
            h.xpanel("") 
            x = h.ref(3)
            h.xpvalue('x', x) 

            def on_button_press():
                print('you pressed the button')

            h.xbutton("press me", on_button_press) 

            h.xpanel() 
            vbox.intercept(False)   # ends intercept mode 
            vbox.map()		        # draw the box and its contents 

        .. image:: ../../images/vbox-intercept.png
            :align: center
         

----



.. method:: VBox.map


    Syntax:
        ``.map("label")``

        ``.map("label", left, top, width, height)``


    Description:
        Make a window out of the box. *Left* and *top* specify placement with 
        respect to screen pixel coordinates where 0,0 is the top left. 
        If you wish to specify the location but use the natural size of 
        the box then use 
        a width of -1. 

    Example:

        .. code-block::
            python

            from neuron import h, gui
            b = h.VBox(2) 
            b.map()          # actually draws the box on the screen 

        creates an empty box on the screen with a light gray inset frame. 

         

----



.. method:: VBox.unmap


    Syntax:
        ``b.unmap()``

        ``b.unmap(accept)``


    Description:
        Dismiss the last mapped window depicting this box. This 
        is called automatically when the last hoc object variable 
        reference 
        to the box is destroyed. 
         
        If the box is in a :meth:`VBox.dialog` the argument refers to the 
        desired return value of the dialog, 1 means accept, 0 means cancel. 

         

----



.. method:: VBox.ismapped


    Syntax:
        ``bool = box.ismapped()``


    Description:
        Return True if box has a window (mapped and not enclosed in another box). 
        Otherwise return False. 


----



.. method:: VBox.size


    Syntax:
        ``box.size(neuron_array_ref)``


    Description:
        If box is mapped and not enclosed in another box, i.e has a window, 
        return left, top, width, height of the window in the first four elements 
        of the array pointed to by the arg. 

    Example:

        .. code-block::
            python
            
            from neuron import h, gui
            import neuron
            import numpy

            def size(obj):
                if obj.ismapped():
                    s = numpy.array([0, 0, 0, 0], 'd')
                    obj.size(neuron.numpy_element_ref(s, 0))
                    print('%s %g %g %g %g' % (obj.hname(), s[0], s[1], s[2], s[3]))

            # create two vboxes, but only map 1
            vb1, vb2 = h.VBox(), h.VBox()
            vb1.map()

            def show_all_sizes():
                for vbox in h.List('VBox'):
                    size(vbox)

            show_all_sizes()

            # can now manually resize the mapped VBox and call show_all_sizes again,
            # if desired



----



.. method:: VBox.save


    Syntax:
        ``box.save("proc_name")``

        ``box.save("string")``

        ``box.save(str, 1)``

        ``box.save(str, obj)``


    Description:
        Execute the procedure when the box is saved. 
         
        The default save procedure is to recursively save all the items 
        in the box. This is almost always the wrong thing to do since 
        all the semantic connections between the items are lost. 
         
        Generally a box is under the control of some high level object 
        which implements the save procedure. 
         
        box.save("string") writes string\n to the open session file. 
         
        box.save(str, 1) returns the open session file name in str. 

         

----



.. method:: VBox.ref


    Syntax:
        ``.ref(objectvar)``


    Description:
        The object is referenced by the box. When the box is dismissed 
        then the object is unreferenced by the box. 
        This provides a way for 
        objects that control a box to be automatically destroyed when 
        the box is dismissed (assuming no other \ ``objectvar`` references 
        the object). When \ ``.ref`` is used, the string in \ ``.save`` is executed 
        in the context of the object. 
         
        Note: When objects are inaccessible to hoc from a normal objref 
        they can still be manipulated from the interpreter through use of 
        their instance name, ie the class name followed by some integer in 
        brackets. As an  alternative one may also 
        use the :func:`dismiss_action` to properly set the state of an 
        object when a box it manages is dismissed from the screen. 

         

----



.. method:: VBox.dismiss_action


    Syntax:
        ``.dismiss_action("command")``


    Description:
        Execute the action when the user dismisses the window. Not executed 
        if the box is not the owner of the window (ie is a part of another 
        deck or box, :meth:`VBox.intercept`). Not executed if 
        the window is dismissed with an :meth:`VBox.unmap` command. 
        For the window to actually close, the command should call unmap 
        on the box. 

         

----



.. method:: VBox.dialog


    Syntax:
        ``b =  box.dialog("label")``

        ``b =  box.dialog("label", "Accept label", "Cancel label")``


    Description:
        Put the box in a dialog and grabs mouse input until the user 
        clicks on :guilabel:`Accept` (return 1) or :guilabel:`Cancel` (return 0). 
         
        The box may be dismissed under program control by calling 
        b.unmap(boolean) where the argument to :meth:`VBox.unmap` 
        is the desired value of the return from the dialog. 

         

----



.. method:: VBox.adjuster


    Syntax:
        ``b.adjuster(start_size)``


    Description:
        When the next item is mapped (see :meth:`VBox.intercept`), its size is fixed at 
        start_size in the sense that resizing the box will preserve the vertical 
        size of the item. Also an adjuster item in the form of a narrow 
        horizontal space is placed just below this item 
        and the "fixed" size can be changed by dragging this space. 
        (also see :meth:`VBox.adjust`).  When adjusters 
        are used, then the :func:`full_request` method should be called on the top level 
        box which is actually mapped to the screen before that top level box is 
        mapped. If full_request is not called then the box will get confused about 
        the proper size of items during window resizing or box adjusting. 

         

----



.. method:: VBox.adjust


    Syntax:
        ``b.adjust(size)``

        ``b.adjust(size, index)``


    Description:
        Change the vertical size of the item mapped just before the first 
        :meth:`VBox.adjuster` was invoked. If multiple adjusters are at the same box level, 
        the index can be used to specify which one is to be adjusted. 

         

----



.. method:: VBox.full_request


    Syntax:
        ``b.full_request(True)``


    Description:
        This works around an error in box management during resize for complicated 
        boxes involving panels with sliders, graphs, and/or :meth:`VBox.adjuster` . 
        If the drawing of boxes does not work properly, this method can be called 
        on the top level box (the one that owns the window) before mapping in 
        order to force a recalculation of internal component request sizes during resize 
        and adjuster changes. 

         

----



.. method:: VBox.priority


    Syntax:
        ``box.priority(integer)``


    Description:
        When a session file is created, the windows with higher priority (larger 
        integer) precede windows with lower priority in the file. 
        This allows windows 
        that define things required by other windows to be saved first. 
        For example, a CellBuild window has a larger priority than a 
        PointProcessManager which needs a section declared by the cell builder. 
        A MulRunFitter has even lower priority since it may refer to the 
        point process managed by the manager. Default priority is 1. 
         
        The priority scheme, of course, does not guarantee that a session file 
        is consistent in isolation since it may depend on windows not saved. 
         
        Priority range is -1000 to 10000 
         
        Some existing priorities are: 

        .. code-block::
            none

            SingleCompartment 1000 
            CellBuild 1000 
            PointProcessManager 990 
            Electrode 990 
            PointGroupManager 980 
            NetworkReadyCell 900 
            ArtificialCell 900 
            NetGUI 700 
            SpikePlot 600 
            Inserter 900 
            RunFitter 100 
            FunctionFitter 100 
            MulRunFitter 100
