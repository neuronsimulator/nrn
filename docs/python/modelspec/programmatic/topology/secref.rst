SectionRef
----------

.. note::

    Much of this functionality is available in Python through :class:`Section` methods in
    recent versions of NEURON. It is, however, sometimes necessary to use this class to
    interoperate with legacy code.


.. class:: SectionRef


    Syntax:
        ``sref = h.SectionRef(sec=section)``


    Description:
        SectionRef keeps a pointer/reference to section. If the ``sec=`` argument is
        omitted, the reference is to the currently accessed section.
         
        This class overcomes a HOC limitation where sections were not treated as objects.

----



.. data:: SectionRef.sec


    Syntax:
        ``sref.sec``


    Description:
        Returns the :class:`Section` the ``SectionRef`` references.

        .. code::

            from neuron import h

            s = h.Section()
            s2 = h.Section()
            sref = h.SectionRef(sec=s2)

            print (sref.sec==s)  # False
            print (sref.sec==s2) # True



----



.. data:: SectionRef.parent


    Syntax:
        ``sref.parent``


    Description:

        Returns the parent of ``sref.sec``.

    .. warning::

        If there is a chance that a section does not have a parent then 
        :meth:`SectionRef.has_parent` should be called first to avoid an execution error. 
        Note that the parent is the current parent of sref.sec, not necessarily 
        the parent when the SectionRef was created. 


----



.. data:: SectionRef.trueparent


    Syntax:
        ``sref.trueparent``


    Description:
        Returns the trueparent of ``sref.sec``.

        This is normally identical to :meth:`SectionRef.parent` except when the 
        parent's :func:`parent_connection` is equal to the parent's 
        :func:`section_orientation`. 

        If there is a chance that a section does not have a trueparent then 
        :meth:`SectionRef.has_trueparent` should be called first to avoid an execution error. 


----



.. data:: SectionRef.child


    Syntax:
        ``sref.child[i]``


    Description:
        Returns the ith child of ``sref.sec``.
        Generally it is used in a context like 

        .. code::
            
            for child in sref.child:
                print(child.hname())

        Note that the children are the current children of sref.sec, not necessarily 
        the same as when the SectionRef was created since sections may be 
        deleted or re-connected subsequent to the instantiation of the SectionRef. 


----



.. data:: SectionRef.root


    Syntax:
        ``sref.root``


    Description:

        Returns the root of ``sref.sec``.


----



.. method:: SectionRef.has_parent


    Syntax:
        ``boolean = sref.has_parent()``


    Description:
        Returns 1.0 if sref.sec has a parent and 0.0 if sref.sec is a root section. 
        Invoking sref.parent when sref.sec is a root section will print an 
        error message and halt execution. 


----



.. method:: SectionRef.has_trueparent


    Syntax:
        ``boolean = sref.has_trueparent()``


    Description:
        returns 1.0 if the sref.sec parent node is not the root node and 0.0 otherwise. 
        Invoking sref.trueparent when it is the root node will print an 
        error message and halt execution. 


----



.. method:: SectionRef.nchild


    Syntax:
        ``num = sref.nchild()``


    Description:
        Return the number of child sections connected to sref.sec as a float.

    .. note::

        To get the number of child sections as an int, use: ``num = len(sref.child)``

         

----



.. method:: SectionRef.is_cas


    Syntax:
        ``boolean = sref.is_cas()``


    Description:
        Returns True if this section reference is the currently accessed (default) section, False otherwise. 

    .. note::

        An equivalent expression is ``(sref.sec == h.cas())``.

         

----



.. method:: SectionRef.exists


    Syntax:
        ``boolean = sref.exists()``


    Description:
        Returns True if the referenced section has not been deleted, False otherwise. 

    .. seealso::
        :func:`delete_section`, :func:`section_exists`
