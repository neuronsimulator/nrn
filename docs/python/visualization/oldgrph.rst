Obsolete Plotting
-----------------

.. warning::

    The functions on this page should be considered obsolete and avoided in new code; use
    :class:`Graph` or regular Python graphics (``matplotlib``, ``plotnine``, ``plotly``, ...)
    instead.



.. function:: graphmode

    obsolete. Use :class:`Graph` instead. 

    Syntax:


        ``n.graphmode(1)``
            Executes the list of setup statements. 
            This is also done on the 
            first call to :func:`n.graph(t) <graph>` after 
            a new setup statement is added to the list. 

        ``n.graphmode(-1)``
            Flushes the stored plots. Subsequent calls to 
            :func:`n.graph(t) <graph>` will start new lines. 
            Should be executed just before a :func:`n.plt(-1) <plt>` to ensure the entire lines 
            are plotted. 

        ``n.graphmode(2)`` 
            Flushes the stored plots. Subsequent calls to 
            :func:`n.graph(t) <graph>` will continue the lines. 
            Graphs are normally flushed every 50 points.

.. function:: graph

    obsolete; use :class:`Graph` instead
         

    Syntax:
        ``n.graph()``

        ``n.graph(expression, setup)``

        ``n.graph(t)``

        ``n.graphmode(mode)``



    Description:
        The :func:`graph` function solves the problem of obtaining multiple line plots during 
        a single run. During calls to ``n.graph(t)``, specified variables are stored 
        and plotted using scales determined by calls to :func:`axis`. 
         

    Options:


        ``n.graph()``
            erases the old list and starts a new (empty) 
            list of plot expressions and setup statements. 

        ``n.graph(s1, s2)``
            Adds a new plot specification 
            to the graph list. s1 must be a
            string which contains a HOC expression, usually a variable. e.g ``"y"``. s2 is a
            string which contains any number of HOC statements used to initialize axes. etc. 
            E.G ``"axis(0,5,1,-1,1,2) axis()"``. 

        ``n.graph(t)`` 
            The current value of each 
            expression in the graph list is saved along with the abscissa value, t. 
            The line plots are flushed every 50 points. 

         

    Example:

        .. code-block::
            python
            
            from neuron import n, gui
            import numpy as np

            # define a HOC variable x
            n('x = 0')


            def p(): # plot ramp 
                n.axis(100, 300, 450, 200) 
                n.axis(0, 15, 3, -1, 1, 2) 
                n.axis() 
                n.plot(1) 
                for n.x in np.arange(0, 15, 0.1):
                    # using n.x instead of x is essential to allow the sin and
                    # cos graphs to update
                    n.plot(n.x, n.x / 15.)    # ramp 
                    n.graph(n.x)  # plots graph list if any
                n.graph(-1)  # flush remaining part of graphs, if any 
                n.plt(-1) 

             
            p()    # plots the ramp alone
             
            n.graph() 
            # x here refers to the variable known to Python as n.x
            n.graph("sin(x)","axis(100, 300, 100, 300) axis()") 
            n.graph("cos(x)", "")  # same axes as previous call to graph
             
            p()    # plots the sin and cos along with the ramp


        .. image:: ../images/oldgrph.png
            :align: center

    Diagnostics:
        The strings are parsed when ``n.graph(s1, s2)`` is executed.  The strings are 
        executed on calls to ``n.graph(t)``. 
         
        The best method for complicated plots is to make the setup string a 
        simple call to a user defined procedure.  This procedure can setup the 
        axes, write the labels, etc.  Newlines and strings within strings are 
        possible by quoting with the ``\`` character but generally are 
        too confusing to be practical. 
         
        Local variables in graph strings make no sense.


    .. note::

        All expressions for initialization and for plotting must be specified as HOC
        expressions not as Python callables. These functions are maintained solely to
        maintain backward compatability, so this limitation is likely to never be lifted.
        New code should use :class:`Graph` instead,
        which does not have this limitation.

    .. note::

        On some modern systems, the graph window may have to be interacted with (e.g. resized)
        before the first graph will appear.

.. function:: axis

    Syntax:

        ``n.axis()``

        ``n.axis(clip)``

        ``n.axis(xorg, xsize, yorg, ysize)``

        ``n.axis(xstart, xstop, nticx, ystart, ystop, nticy)``

    Options:

        ``n.axis()`` 
            draw axes with label values. Closes plot device. 

        ``n.axis(clip)`` 
            points are not plotted if they are a factor ``clip`` off the axis scale. 
            Default is no clipping. Set ``clip`` to 1 to not plot out of axis region. 
            A value of 1.1 allows plotting slightly outside the axis boundaries. 

        ``n.axis(xorg, xsize, yorg, ysize)`` 
            Size and location of the plot region. 
            (Use the :func:`n.plt() <plt>` absolute coordinates.) 

        ``n.axis(xstart, xstop, nticx, ystart, ystop, nticy)`` 
            Determines relative scale and origin.

.. function:: plot


    Syntax:

        ``n.plot(mode)``

        ``inrange = n.plot(x, y)``



    Description:
        ``n.plot()`` plots relative to the origin and scale defined by 
        calls to :func:`axis`.  The default x and y axes have relative units of 0 to 1 with the plot 
        located in a 5x3.5 inch area. 
         

    Options:


        ``n.plot()`` 
            print parameter usage help lines. 

        ``n.plot(0)`` 
            subsequent calls will plot points. 

        ``n.plot(1)`` 
            next call will be a move, subsequent call will draw lines. 

        ``n.plot(x, y)`` 
            plots a point (or vector) relative to the axis scale. 
            Return value is 0 if the point is clipped (out of range). 

        ``n.plot(mode, x, y)`` 
            Like :func:`plt` but with scale and origin given by :func:`axis`. 

         

    Example:

        .. code-block::
            python

            from neuron import n, gui
            import numpy as np

            # plot the sin function from 0 to 10 radians 
            n.axis(0, 10, 5, -1, 1, 2) # setup scale 
            n.plot(1) 
            for x in np.linspace(0, 10, 100):
                n.plot(x, np.sin(x))  # plot the function

            n.axis()

.. function:: setcolor

    obsolete.   

    Syntax:

        ``n.setcolor(colorval)``

    Description:
        
        ``n.setcolor()`` sets the color (or pen number for HP plotter) used for :func:`plt`.

        Argument to ``n.setcolor()`` produces the following screen 
        colors with an EGA adapter (left), X11 graphics (right):

.. function:: plt


    Syntax:
        ``n.plt(mode)``

        ``n.plt(mode, x, y)``



    Description:
        
        ``n.plt()`` plots points, lines, and text using 
        the Tektronix 4010 standard. Absolute 
        coordinates of the lower left corner and upper right corner of the plot 
        region are (0,0) and (1000, 780) respectively. 
         
        TURBO-C graphics drivers for VGA, EGA, CGA, and Hercules are automatically 
        selected when the first plotting command is executed. An HP7475 compatible 
        plotter may be connected to COM1:. 
         

    Options:


        ``n.plt(-1)`` 
            Place cursor in home position. 

        ``n.plt(-2)`` 
            Subsequent text printed starting at current coordinate position. 

        ``n.plt(-3)`` 
            Erase screen, cursor in home position. 

        ``n.plt(-5)`` 
            Open HP plotter on PC; the plotter will stay open until another ``n.plt(-5)`` is executed.


        ``n.plt(0, x, y)`` 
            Plot point. 

        ``n.plt(1, x, y)`` 
            Move to point without plotting. 

        ``n.plt(2, x, y)`` 
            Draw vector from former position to new position given by (x, y). 
            (*mode* can be any number >= 2) 

        Several extra options are available for X11 graphics. 


        ``n.plt(-4, x, y)`` 
            Erases area defined by previous plot position and 
            the point, (x, y). 

        ``n.plt(-5)`` 
            Fast mode. By default, the X11 server is flushed on every 
            plot command so one can see the plot as it develops. Fast mode caches plot 
            commands and only flushes on ``plt(-1)`` and ``setcolor()``.  Fast mode is 
            three times faster than the default mode.  It is most useful when 
            plotting is the rate limiting step of the simulation. 

        ``n.plt(-6)`` 
            X11 server flushed on every plot call. 

        When the graphic window is resized, NEURON is notified after 
        the next erase command. 
         


         

    Example:

        .. code-block::
            python

            from neuron import n, gui
            import math

            n.setcolor(3)      # color 3 is red for X11; to use with EGA, change to 4
            n.plt(1, 100, 500)  
            n.plt(2, 100, 100) # y-axis 
            n.plt(1, 100, 300)  
            n.plt(2, 600, 300) # x-axis (NOTE: does not correspond to origin of sine wave)
            n.plt(1, 200, 550) 
            n.plt(-2)  
            for i in range(1001):
                n.plt(i + 1, i * 5, 300 + 200 * math.sin(2 * math.pi * i / 100.)) 

            n.plt(-1) # close plot

    .. warning::
        EGA adaptor used extensively but CGA and Hercules used hardly at all. 
         
        When the X11 graphic window is killed, NEURON exits without asking about 
        unsaved edit buffers.
