RangeVarPlot

.. class:: RangeVarPlot


    Syntax:
        ``h.RangeVarPlot("rangevar" [, start_segment, stop_segment])``
        

        ``h.RangeVarPlot(py_callable [, start_segment, stop_segment])``


    Description:
        Class for making a space plot. eg. voltage as function of path between 
        two points on a cell.  Specification of the start and stop segments is
        optional, but if one is specified both must be specified.
        
        For Interviews plotting, an object of this type needs 
        to be inserted in a Graph with ``g.addobject(rvp)``. Alternatively, in
        NEURON 7.7+, the RangeVarPlot's plot method can be used to plot a snapshot
        of the values on a Graph object, a bokeh plot, a matplotlib plot, or anything
        with a compatible interface to the last two.
        By default, the location of the path nearest the root is location 0 
        (the origin) of the space plot. 
         
        If the *rangevar* does not exist at certain places in the path it 
        is assumed to have a value of 0. 
         
        The first form where *rangevar* is "*v*" or "*m_hh*", etc. is very 
        efficient since the object can store pointers to the variables 
        for fast plotting. 
         
        The second form is much slower since the expression 
        must be executed by the interpreter for each point along the path 
        for each plot.  Execution of the expression is equivalent to 
        \ ``for sec in h.allsec(): for seg in sec: f(seg.x)``
        where the expression is the body of f. All section-dependent NEURON
        functions will default to the correct section for the call; i.e. there is no need
        to say ``sec=`` unless you want to refer to a section that is not the one
        whose data is being plotted. The current section may be read via ``h.cas()``.

        In NEURON 7.7+, RangeVarPlot's constructor takes optional begin and end arguments.
        In Python, these would typically be segments, but they can also be normalized position 
        on a single segment.

            from neuron import h, gui

            dend1 = h.Section(name='dend1')
            dend2 = h.Section(name='dend2')

            for sec in h.allsec():
                sec.nseg = sec.L = 501
                sec.diam = 1

            dend2.connect(dend1)

            ic = h.IClamp(dend1(0.5))
            ic.amp = 0.5
            ic.delay = 0
            ic.dur = 1

            h.finitialize(-65)
            h.continuerun(1)

            rvp = h.RangeVarPlot('v', dend1(0), dend2(1))
            g = h.Graph()
            g.addobject(rvp)
            g.size(0, 1002, -70, 50)

                sec.diam = 1

            dend2.connect(dend1)

            def my_func(x):
                sec = h.cas()  # find out which section
                if sec == dend1:
                    y = x ** 2
                else:
                    y = 1 + x ** 2
                return y

            rvp = h.RangeVarPlot(my_func, dend1(0), dend2(1))
            g = h.Graph()
            g.addobject(rvp)
            g.size(0, 1002, 0, 2)
            g.flush()

            imp = h.Impedance()

            rvp = h.RangeVarPlot(imp.transfer)
            rvp... #specify range begin and end 
            imp... #specify impedance computation 
            g = h.Graph() 
            g.addobject(rvp)

.. method:: RangeVarPlot.plot


    Syntax:
        ``rvp.plot(graph_object)``
        
        ``rvp.plot(graph_object, arg1, ..., kwarg1=val1, ...)``


    Description:
        In NEURON 7.7+, RangeVarPlot.plot plots the current state of the path on any of a number of types of graphs,
        including NEURON Graph objects, matplotlib, bokeh, and anything with a .plot or .line method taking x and y values. 
        Any additional arguments or keyword arguments are passed to the graph's plotting method. 

    Example: 
        Plotting to a matplotlib axis (instead of pyplot itself), bokeh, and NEURON's Graph objects and passing optional
        arguments to each:

        .. code-block::
            python

            from neuron import h, gui
            from matplotlib import pyplot
            import bokeh.plotting as b
            import math

            dend = h.Section(name='dend')
            dend.nseg = 55
            dend.L = 6.28

            #looping over dend.allseg instead of dend to set 0 and 1 ends
            for seg in dend.allseg():
                seg.v = math.sin(dend.L * seg.x)

            r = h.RangeVarPlot('v', dend(0), dend(1)) #Three argument constructor in 7.7+

            #matplotlib 
            graph = pyplot.gca()
            r.plot(graph, linewidth=10, color='r')

            #NEURON graph
            g = h.Graph()
            r.plot(g, 2, 3)
            g.exec_menu('View = plot')

            #Bokeh
            bg = b.Figure()
            r.plot(bg, line_width=10)
            b.show(bg)

            pyplot.show()

.. method:: RangeVarPlot.begin


    Syntax:
        ``rvp.begin(segment)``
        
        ``rvp.begin(x, sec=section)``


    Description:
        Begins the path for the space plot at the specified segment. Using the first syntax
        is recommended in later code; the second is another way to specify the segment ``section(x)``.
    
    .. note::
    
         Beginning with NEURON 7.7, one can also specify the beginning and ending segments in the
         RangeVarPlot constructor; e.g. ``rvp = h.RangeVarPlot('v', soma(0), distal(1)``
         

----



.. method:: RangeVarPlot.end


    Syntax:
        ``rvp.end(segment)``
        
        ``rvp.end(x, sec=section)``


    Description:
        Ends the path for the space plot at the specified segment. Using the first syntax
        is recommended in later code; the second is another way to specify the segment ``section(x)``.
    
    .. note::
    
         Beginning with NEURON 7.7, one can also specify the beginning and ending segments in the
         RangeVarPlot constructor; e.g. ``rvp = h.RangeVarPlot('v', soma(0), distal(1)``

         

----



.. method:: RangeVarPlot.origin


    Syntax:
        ``rvp.origin(x, sec=section)``


    Description:
        Defines the origin (location 0) of the space plot as ``section(x)``.
        The default is usually 
        suitable unless you want to have several rangvarplots in one graph 
        in which case this function is used to arrange all the plots relative 
        to each other. 

         

----



.. method:: RangeVarPlot.left


    Syntax:
        ``rvp.left()``


    Description:
        returns the coordinate of the beginning of the path. 

         

----



.. method:: RangeVarPlot.right


    Syntax:
        ``rvp.right()``


    Description:
        returns the coordinate of the end of the path. The total length 
        of the path is ``rvp.right() - rvp.left()``. 

         

----



.. method:: RangeVarPlot.list


    Syntax:
        ``rvp.list(sectionlist)``


    Description:
        append the path of sections to the :class:`SectionList` object argument. 
         


----



.. method:: RangeVarPlot.color


    Syntax:
        ``rvp.color(index)``


    Description:
        Change the color property. To see the change on an already plotted 
        RangeVarPlot in a Graph, the Graph should be :meth:`~Graph.flush`\ ed. 

         

----



.. method:: RangeVarPlot.vector


    Syntax:
        ``yvec = rvp.vector()``

    Description:
        Copy the range variable values to a new :class:`Vector` yvec.
        (``len(yvec)`` will be equal to the number of range points.)

    Note:
        New in NEURON 8.0.

    .. seealso::
        :meth:`Graph.addobject`

         


----



.. method:: RangeVarPlot.to_vector


    Syntax:
        ``rvp.to_vector(yvec)``

        ``rvp.to_vector(yvec, xvec)``


    Description:
        Copy the range variable values to the :func:`Vector` yvec. yvec is resized 
        to the number of range points. If the second arg is present then 
        the locations are copied to xvec. A plot of \ ``yvec.line(g, xvec)`` would 
        be identical to a plot using \ ``g.addobject(rvp)``. Returns the number of
        range points.

    .. seealso::
        :meth:`Graph.addobject`


----



.. method:: RangeVarPlot.from_vector


    Syntax:
        ``rvp.from_vector(yvec)``


    Description:
        Copy the values in yvec to the range variables along the rvp path. 
        The size of the vector must be consistent with rvp.
