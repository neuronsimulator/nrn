## NEURON Documentation

### Online

Latest NEURON documentation is available on:

* ReadTheDocs @ [https://nrn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/](https://nrn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

Contents:

* Documentation on building NEURON
* User documentation (HOC, Python, tutorials, rxd)
* Developer documentation (SCM, technical topics, Doxygen)

### On pull requests

The documentation is built automatically as part of continuous integration (CI) when a pull request is opened, under the name `docs/readthedocs.org:nrn`.
Upon success, it can viewed by clicking on the "Details" link to the right of the name.
If the build fails, the logs will be available at the same link.

### Local build

To build the NEURON documentation, one needs to install the same prerequisites as for building NEURON itself; see the [install instructions](./install/install_instructions.md) for a complete list of build dependencies.

#### Virtual environment
It is recommended to use a Python virtual environment, for example:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

In order to build documentation locally, you need to pip install the ``docs_requirements.txt`` :
```
pip3 install -r docs/docs_requirements.txt --upgrade
```

Also, make sure to have `Doxygen` and `pandoc` installed.
On MacOS, you can install these packages using `brew`:

```bash
brew install doxygen pandoc
```

#### Confguring the build

With all dependencies installed, configure project with CMake (>= v3.17) as described in [CMake Build Options](./cmake_doc/options.rst#nrn-enable-docs-bool-off).

e.g. in your CMake build folder:

```
cmake .. -DNRN_ENABLE_DOCS=ON
```

#### Building the documentation

Note that executing the jupyter notebooks requires working NEURON installation. So make sure the neuron python
module can be imported. For this, you can build and install neuron from source first or you could also do a
`pip install neuron` (in case you don't want/need to compile NEURON from source).

In order to build the full documentation (Doxygen, Jupyter notebooks, Sphinx):
```
make docs
```
That will build everything in the `nrn/docs/_build` folder from where you can open `index.html` locally.

In case you just want the Sphinx build to be performed(i.e. you are not working on Jupyter notebooks or doxygen):
```
make sphinx
```

#### Faster Local Iterations

When working locally on documentation, depending on what you work on, be aware of the following targets to speed up building process:

* `doxygen` 			- build the API documentation only. Ends up in ``_generated`` folder under ``docs``.
* `notebooks` 			- execute & embed outputs in-place into jupyter notebooks, see [notebooks.sh](notebooks.sh)
* `notebooks-clean`     - clears outputs from notebooks. Remember that executing notebooks will add outputs in-place, and we don't want those committed to the repo.
* `sphinx` 				- build Sphinx documentation

**NOTE**:
* `docs` target calls: `doxygen` `notebooks` `sphinx` and `notebooks-clean`.
* `sphinx` target is the one that will assemble all generated output (doxygen, notebooks).

### ReadTheDocs setup

#### Config file

Configuration file is in the top directory: [../.readthedocs.yml](../.readthedocs.yml).

#### Documentation not handled by RTD

For RTD we need to call `doxygen` and `notebooks` make targets, since only `sphinx` executable is called therein.

#### Leveraging `conf.py`

The only way to gather extra documentation in RTD is to make use of `conf.py`.
Have a look at `if os.environ.get("READTHEDOCS"):` block in [conf.py](conf.py) to see how we leverage the aforementioned targets and outputs.

#### Notebooks execution with `neuron` wheels

For `notebooks` we are using `neuron` Python wheel as follows:
* `neuron-nightly` for `master` RTD builds.
* `neuron==X.Y.Z` for `release` RTD builds. Note that wheels need to be published first (see next section).

To achieve this, we parse the RTD environment variable `READTHEDOCS_VERSION` and `pip install` it (see [conf.py](conf.py)).

#### New release on RTD

To create a new public release on RTD, follow these steps:

* create a new release (see [GHA Neuron Release - Manual Workflow](https://github.com/neuronsimulator/nrn/actions?query=workflow%3A%22NEURON+Release%22))
* publish the wheels (these will be pip-installed by RTD)
* go to [NRN RTD Versions page](https://readthedocs.org/projects/nrn/versions/) and activate the new tag. Make sure that the version is not marked as hidden.

**NOTE**: builds can be re-launched as many times as needed
