Removed Features
================

This page aims at providing a short knowledge base designed to track dropped and potentially useful features for future development.
To that end, the following table's columns constitute:

* the name of the feature; it will also be used to tag last commit holding the feature.
* a short description; the main purpose is to have the feature as greppable as possible.
* removal PR number(s) related to their removal from the codebase.
