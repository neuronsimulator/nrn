This page aims at providing a short knowledge base designed to track dropped and potentially useful features for future development.
To that end, the following table's columns constitute:

* the name of the feature; also stands as a keyword.
* a short description; the main purpose is to have the feature as greppable as possible.
* removal PR number(s) related to their removal from the codebase.
* Short SHA pointing to the last master commit holding the feature for easy checkout.
