The NMODL Jupyter notebooks
===========================

About the notebooks
-------------------

To help you get started we have created several `Jupyter notebooks <https://jupyter.org/>`_, which cover many aspects of using NMODL from Python
beginning from basic model parsing and AST visualization, continuing with using and writing your own AST visitors, and
finally understanding and using the NMODL ODE solvers. You can find the notebooks
`here <https://github.com/BlueBrain/nmodl/tree/master/docs/notebooks>`_ to run and test yourself.
