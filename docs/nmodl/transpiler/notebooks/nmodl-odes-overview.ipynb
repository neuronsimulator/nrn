    "### NMODL integration of ODEs\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an overview of\n",
    "  - the different ways a user can specify the equations that define the system they want to simulate in the MOD file\n",
    "  - how these equations can be related to each other\n",
    "  - how these equations are solved in NMODL\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "The user can specify information about the system in a variety of ways:\n",
    "  - A high level way to describe a system is to specify a Mass Action Kinetic scheme of reaction equations in a `KINETIC` block\n",
    "  - Alternatively a system of ODEs can be specified in a `DERIVATIVE` block (any kinetic scheme can also be written as a system of ODEs)\n",
    "  - Finally a system of linear/non-linear algebraic equations can be specified in a `LINEAR`/`NONLINEAR` block (a numerical integration scheme, such as backwards Euler, transforms a system of ODEs into a system of linear or non-linear equations)\n",
    "\n",
    "To reduce duplication of functionality for dealing with these related systems, we implement a hierarchy of transformations:\n",
    "  - `KINETIC` blocks of reaction statements are translated to `DERIVATIVE` blocks of equivalent ODE systems using the law of Mass Action\n",
    "  - `DERIVATIVE` blocks of ODEs are translated to `(NON)LINEAR` blocks of algebraic equations using a numerical integration scheme\n",
    "\n",
    "After these transformations we are left with only `LINEAR`/`NONLINEAR` blocks that are then solved numerically (by Gaussian Elimination, LU factorization or Newton iteration)\n",
