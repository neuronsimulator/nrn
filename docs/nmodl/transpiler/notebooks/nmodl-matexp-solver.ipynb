    "### NMODL matexp solver\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook describes the implementation of the `matexp` solver, which solves the systems of ODEs defined in `KINETIC` blocks when the ODEs are *linear* and *coupled*.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a more general tutorial on using the NMODL python interface, please see the [tutorial notebook](nmodl-python-tutorial.ipynb).\n",

    "#### Mathematics\n",
    "ODEs are linear if they can be written in the form $\\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial t} = A \\cdot x$ where $x$ is the state vector of the model and $A$ is the Jacobian matrix. The analytic solution to this initial value problem is $x = e^{A \\Delta t} \\cdot x_0$. The matrix $e^{A \\Delta t}$ is known as the *propagator* matrix and it advances the state of the model by one time step. Since this is the exact solution, it is compatible with the Crank−Nicholson method which requires at least second-order accuracy.\n",

    "#### Implementation\n",
    "The `MatexpVisitor` implements the solver method `matexp`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The visitor does the following:\n",
    "* visit SOLVE statements to\n",
    "    * determines which KINETIC blocks to solve\n",
    "    * replace the SOLVE statement with a call to the solved PROCEDURE block\n",
    "* visit KINETIC blocks to generate solved PROCEDURE blocks\n",
    "    * first copy the KINETIC block into a new PROCEDURE block\n",
    "        * append `_matexp` to the name of the new block\n",
    "        * append `_steadystate` for steadystate solution\n",
    "    * define the Jacobian matrix using the Eigen library by inserting a VERBATIM statement at the start of the block\n",
    "    * replace reaction statements with equivalent assignments to the Jacobian matrix\n",
    "        * For example `X <-> Y (A, B)` would become:\n",
    "            * `J[X, X] -= A`\n",
    "            * `J[Y, X] += A`\n",
    "            * `J[Y, Y] -= B`\n",
    "            * `J[X, Y] += B`\n",
    "    * append the solution to the end of the block in a VERBATIM statement to\n",
    "        * compute the propagator matrix and use it to advance the state of the model\n",
    "        * conserve the sum of the states, if applicable\n",
    "            * scale each state variable by the expected sum divided by the actual sum\n",

    "#### Matrix Exponential Function\n",
    "The exponential function is defined over matrices as well as scalars by its Taylor series expansion $e^x = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{x^n}{n!}$. However, computing the exponential function by evaluating its Taylor series is slow and numerically unstable. There are many faster and more accurate methods of calculating the matrix exponential function. The NEURON simulator uses the [Eigen](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org) library for its advanced linear algebra functions, including for the matrix exponential function. For this task, the Eigen library implements the algorithm introduced in the publication:\n",
