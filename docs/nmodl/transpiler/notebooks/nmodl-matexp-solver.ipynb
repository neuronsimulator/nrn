    "### NMODL matexp solver\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook describes the implementation of the `matexp` solver, which solves the systems of ODEs defined in `KINETIC` blocks when the ODEs are *linear* and *coupled*.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a more general tutorial on using the NMODL python interface, please see the [tutorial notebook](nmodl-python-tutorial.ipynb).\n",

    "#### Mathematics\n",
    "ODEs are linear if they can be written in the form $\\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial t} = A \\cdot x$ where $x$ is the state vector of the model and $A$ is the Jacobian matrix. The analytic solution to this initial value problem is $x = e^{A \\Delta t} \\cdot x_0$. The matrix $e^{A \\Delta t}$ is known as the *propagator* matrix and it advances the state of the model by one time step. Since this is the exact solution, it is compatible with the Crank−Nicholson method which requires at least second-order accuracy.\n",

    "#### Matrix Exponential Function\n",
    "The exponential function is defined over matrices as well as scalars by its Taylor series expansion $e^x = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{x^n}{n!}$. However, computing the exponential function by evaluating its Taylor series is slow and numerically unstable. There are many faster and more accurate methods of calculating the matrix exponential function. The NEURON simulator uses the [Eigen](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org) library for its advanced linear algebra functions, including for the matrix exponential function. For this function, the Eigen library implements the algorithm introduced in the publication:\n",

    "#### Implementation\n",
    "The `MatexpVisitor` implements the solver method `matexp`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The visitor does the following:\n",
    "* make lists of all `SOLVE` statements and `KINETIC` blocks in the program\n",
    "* for each `SOLVE` block statement with method `matexp`\n",
    "    * find the corresponding `KINETIC` block and convert it into a `MATEXP_BLOCK`\n",
    "    * if `STEADYSTATE`:\n",
    "        * replace the `SOLVE ... STEADYSTATE` statement with the `MATEXP_BLOCK`\n",
    "    * else:\n",
    "        * remove the `SOLVE ... METHOD` block statement\n",
    "        * append the `MATEXP_BLOCK` to the program\n",
    "* remove the solved `KINETIC` blocks\n",
    "\n",
    "During the code generation phase, all MATEXP_BLOCKs that were appended to the program are moved into the state update function. Then MATEXP_BLOCKs generate code in-place either in the initialization function or in the state update function. MATEXP_BLOCKs generate the following code:\n",
    "* define and zero-init the Jacobian matrix using the Eigen library\n",
    "* insert the body of the kinetic block\n",
    "    * replace reaction statements with equivalent assignments to the Jacobian matrix\n",
    "        * For example `~ X <-> Y (A, B)` would become:\n",
    "            * `J[X, X] -= A`\n",
    "            * `J[Y, X] += A`\n",
    "            * `J[Y, Y] -= B`\n",
    "            * `J[X, Y] += B`\n",
    "* initialize the state vector\n",
    "* define the solution vector as `solution = jacobian.exp() * state`\n",
    "* conserve the sum of the states, if applicable\n",
    "    * multiply each state variable by the expected sum divided by the actual sum\n",
    "* assign the solution vector to the state variables\n",

    "#### Tests Cases\n",
    "The unit tests may be helpful to understand what these functions are doing\n",
    "  - `MatexpVisitor` tests are located in [test/nmodl/transpiler/unit/visitor/matexp.cpp](https://github.com/neuronsimulator/nrn/blob/master/test/nmodl/transpiler/unit/visitor/matexp.cpp) and have the tag `[matexp]`\n",
    "  - The integration test compares two formulations of the same Hodgkin-Huxley model, the first model is a standard HH model solved by `cnexp`, the second model is modified so that each gate (\"M\", \"H\", and \"N\") is a two state Markov model solved by `matexp`. These two models yield identical outputs\n",
