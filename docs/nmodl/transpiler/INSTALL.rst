Installing the NMODL Framework
==============================

Getting Started
---------------

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on
your local machine for development and testing purposes.

Cloning Source
--------------

The NMODL Framework is maintained on github. The best way to get the
sources is to simply clone the repository.

**Note**: This project uses git submodules which must be cloned along
with the repository itself:

.. code:: sh

   git clone --recursive https://github.com/BlueBrain/nmodl.git
   cd nmodl

Prerequisites
-------------

To build the project from source, a modern C++ compiler with C++14
support is necessary. Make sure you have following packages available:

-  flex (>=2.6)
-  bison (>=3.0)
-  CMake (>=3.15)
-  Python (>=3.9)
-  Python packages : jinja2 (>=2.10), pyyaml (>=3.13), pytest (>=4.0.0),
   sympy (>=1.3), textwrap

On MacOS
~~~~~~~~

Typically the versions of bison and flex provided by the system are
outdated and not compatible with our requirements. To get recent version
of all dependencies we recommend using `homebrew <https://brew.sh/>`__:

.. code:: sh

   brew install flex bison cmake python3

All of the Python dependencies (build, run, and development) can be installed
using:

.. code:: sh

   pip3 install --user -r requirements.txt

Make sure to have latest flex/bison in your ``PATH``:

.. code:: sh

   export PATH=/usr/local/opt/flex/bin:/usr/local/opt/bison/bin:/usr/local/bin/:$PATH

On Apple M1, corresponding brew paths are under ``/opt/homebrew/opt/``:

.. code:: sh

   export PATH=/opt/homebrew/opt/flex/bin:/opt/homebrew/opt/bison/bin:$PATH

On Ubuntu
~~~~~~~~~

On Ubuntu (>=18.04) flex/bison versions are recent enough and are
installed along with the system toolchain:

.. code:: sh

   apt-get install flex bison gcc python3 python3-pip

All of the Python dependencies (build, run, and development) can be installed
using:

.. code:: sh

   pip3 install --user -r requirements.txt

Build Project
-------------

Using CMake
~~~~~~~~~~~

Once all dependencies are in place, build project as:

.. code:: sh

   mkdir -p nmodl/build
   cd nmodl/build
   cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$HOME/nmodl
   cmake --build . --parallel 4 --target install

.. hint::

   By default ``NMODL`` is build with the ``CMake`` option
   ``NMODL_ENABLE_PYTHON_BINDINGS`` set to ``ON`` which increases a lot
   the compilation complexity and memory requirements. For that purpose
   it’s recommended to either disable this option if the Python bindings
   are not needed or restrict the number of parallel jobs running in
   parallel in the ``cmake`` command using
   ``cmake --parallel <number_of_parallel_jobs>``. i.e. in a machine
   with 8 threads do ``cmake --parallel 4``.

And set ``PYTHONPATH`` as:

.. code:: sh

   export PYTHONPATH=$HOME/nmodl/lib:$PYTHONPATH

Flex / Bison Paths
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If flex / bison are not in your default ``PATH``, you can provide the path
to cmake as:

.. code:: sh

   cmake .. -DFLEX_EXECUTABLE=/usr/local/opt/flex/bin/flex \
            -DBISON_EXECUTABLE=/usr/local/opt/bison/bin/bison \
            -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$HOME/nmodl

Using the Python build system
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you are mainly interested in the NMODL Framework parsing and analysis
tools and wish to use them from Python, we recommend building and
installing using Python.

.. code:: sh

   pip3 install --user .

This should build the NMODL framework and install it into your pip user
``site-packages`` folder such that it becomes available as a Python
module.

Building a wheel
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can also build a wheel you can test and install in another environment using:

.. code:: sh

   pip3 wheel . --no-deps [-C OPTION1=VALUE1 -C OPTION2=VALUE2...] [--wheel-dir DIRECTORY]

where the various ``OPTION`` values describe the build options (for a list of
all available options, please consult the `reference <https://scikit-build-core.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configuration.html>`_).
Notably, due to a bug in CMake, on MacOS one should pass ``-C build-dir=DIRECTORY`` to the above.

When building without linking against libpython
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

NMODL uses an embedded python to symbolically evaluate differential
equations. For this to work we would usually link against libpython,
which is automatically taken care of by pybind11. In some cases, for
instance when building a python wheel, we cannot link against libpython,
because we cannot know where it will be at runtime. Instead, we load the
python library (along with a wrapper library that manages calls to
embedded python) at runtime. To disable linking against python and
enabling dynamic loading of libpython at runtime we need to configure
the build with the cmake option ``-DLINK_AGAINST_PYTHON=False``.

In order for NMODL binaries to know where to find libpython and our own
libpywrapper two environment variables need to be present:

-  ``NMODL_PYLIB``: This variable should point to the libpython
   shared-object (or dylib) file. On macos this could be for example:

.. code:: sh

   export NMODL_PYLIB=/usr/local/Cellar/python/3.7.7/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.7/Python

**Note**: In order for all unit tests to function correctly when
building without linking against libpython we must set ``NMODL_PYLIB``
before running cmake!

Testing the Installed Module
----------------------------

If you have installed the NMODL Framework using CMake, you can now run
tests from the build directory as:

.. code:: bash

   $ make test
   Running tests...
   Test project /Users/kumbhar/workarena/repos/bbp/incubator/nocmodl/cmake-build-debug

    8/60 Test  #8: testparser/Scenario: Legacy differential equation solver from NEURON solve number of ODE ...   Passed    0.00 sec
    ...

To test the NMODL Framework python bindings, you can try a minimal
example in your Python 3 interpeter as follows:

.. code:: python

   >>> import nmodl.dsl as nmodl
   >>> driver = nmodl.NmodlDriver()
   >>> modast = driver.parse_string("NEURON { SUFFIX hh }")
   >>> print ('%s' % modast)
   {"Program":[{"NeuronBlock":[{"StatementBlock":[{"Suffix":[{"Name":[{"String":[{"name":"SUFFIX"}]}]},{"Name":[{"String":[{"name":"hh"}]}]}]}]}]}]}
   >>> print (nmodl.to_nmodl(modast))
   NEURON {
       SUFFIX hh
   }

You can also run all of the Python tests for a given wheel using:

.. code:: sh

   bash packaging/test_wheel.bash PYTHON_EXECUTABLE WHEEL

where ``PYTHON_EXECUTABLE`` should be replaced by the path to the Python
executable, and ``WHEEL`` should be replaced by the path to the wheel you wish
to test.

NMODL is now setup correctly!

Generating Documentation
------------------------

In order to build the documentation you must have additionally
``pandoc`` installed. Use your system’s package manager to do this
(e.g. ``sudo apt-get install pandoc``).

You can build the entire documentation simply by using the ``generate_docs.sh``
script:

.. code:: sh

   bash docs/generate_docs.sh DIRECTORY [PYTHON_EXECUTABLE]

where ``DIRECTORY`` is where you want to put the output files. The HTML
documentation will then be available in ``DIRECTORY/docs``, and the temporary
build will be stored in ``DIRECTORY/build``. You can also specify the path to
the Python executable if it is not picked up automatically.
