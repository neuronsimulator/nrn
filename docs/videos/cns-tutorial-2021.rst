CNS 2021 Online Tutorial
========================

In this 5h16m tutorial, lecturers Bill Lytton, Robert McDougal, Adam Newton, and Salvador Dura-Bernal introduce the basics of modeling with NEURON and NetPyNE. Several follow-along tutorials are included, all of which can be done through the cloud at no cost; no software installation is required.

Specifically, we demonstrate the use of NEURON through `Google Colab <http://colab.research.google.com>`_ and the use of NetPyNE's `cloud-based GUI <http://gui.netpyne.org>`_.
