Inserter
--------

 
Insert and remove mechanisms.  Keep default parameters between removal 
and re-insertion.  Most useful in context of single compartment 
simulations. 
 
Note that when a mechanism is removed by clicking on a checkmarked 
mechanism, the parameters are saved in a MechanismStandard. When 
the Mechanism is re-installed, those parameters are restored. 
 
If the Inserter panel is saved in a session, the MechanismStandards are 
saved as well.
