NEURON can be installed on a wide variety of hardware platforms. Based on your system and software
environment you can choose one of the installation method described below.

## Installing Binary Distribution

If you want to quickly get started with NEURON, we provide binary installers for Linux, Mac and
Windows platforms.

#### Windows

On Windows only recommended way to install NEURON is using binary installer. You can download alpha
or recent releases from below URLs:

* [Alpha releases](https://neuron.yale.edu/ftp/neuron/versions/alpha/)
* [Recent Releases](https://neuron.yale.edu/ftp/neuron/versions/)

Windows installers have name in the format of `nrn-<version-id>-mingw-py-27-36-37-38-39-setup.exe`.
The `py-27-36-37-38-39` string in the installer name indicates that the given installer is compatible
with Python versions 2.7, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9. Once the installer is downloaded, you can install it
by double clicking like any other Windows application. Note that you have to install python separately
if python support is required. You can find detailed step-by-step instructions in [this presentation]
(https://neuron.yale.edu/ftp/neuron/nrn_mswin_install.pdf).

#### Mac OS

Since version 7.8.1 we are providing Python wheels and NEURON can be installed using `pip` as:

```
pip3 install neuron
```

With pip only Python3 wheels are provided via [pypi.org](https://pypi.org/project/NEURON/).

Like Windows, you can also use a binary installer to install NEURON. You can download alpha or recent
releases from below URLs:

* [Alpha releases](https://neuron.yale.edu/ftp/neuron/versions/alpha/)
* [Recent Releases](https://neuron.yale.edu/ftp/neuron/versions/)

Mac OS installers have name in the format of `nrn-<version-id>-osx-27-36-37-38-39.pkg`. Like windows
installer, `py-27-36-37-38-39` string in the installer name indicates that the given installer is
compatible with Python versions 2.7, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9. Note that if you double-click the installer
then you might see warning like below. In this case you have to right-click on the installer and then
click `Open`. You can then see an option to `Open` installer: 

![Installer Warning](docs/_static/osx_installer_warning_solution.png "Mac OS Warning")

This will install NEURON under directory `/Applications/NEURON-<version>/` directory. For GUI support you
have to install [XQuartz](https://www.xquartz.org/) separately. Once you start Terminal application, NEURON
binaries (`nrniv`, `neurondemo` etc.) should be available to start.

#### Linux

Like Mac OS, since 7.8.1 release python wheels are provided and you can use `pip` to install NEURON as:

```
pip3 install neuron
```

Note that only Python3 wheels are provided. Note that for recent releases we are not providing .rpm or
.deb installers.

## Installing Source Distributions

If you are running NEURON in cluster/HPC environment where you would like to have better performance
(e.g. using vendor compilers like Intel, Cray, AMD, NVIDIA etc.), we advise you to build the NEURON
from source. Note that to use CoreNEURON with optimised CPU/GPU support, you have to install NEURON
from source.

Currently, we are supporting two build systems:

- [CMake](#build-cmake) (__recommended__)
- [Autotools](#build-autotools) (legacy, minimum support)

Starting with the 8.0 release, we recommend users to use CMake as the primary build system for NEURON.
We would be grateful for any feedback or issues you encounter using the CMake-based build system.
Please [report any issue here](https://github.com/neuronsimulator/nrn/issues) and we will be happy to help. In addition to the instructions below, you can find up to date build scripts for different platforms in [nrn-build-ci](https://github.com/neuronsimulator/nrn-build-ci#scheduled-ci-builds-for-neuron) repository.

**If you are using autotools, we highly recommend switching to CMake.**

### Install Build Dependencies

In order to build NEURON from source, the following packages must be available:

- Bison
- Flex
- C/C++ compiler suite
- CMake 3.8 or Autotools

The following packages are optional (see build options):

- Python >=2.7, or Python >=3.5 (for Python interface)
- Cython (for RXD)
- MPI (for parallel)
- X11 (Linux) or XQuartz (MacOS) (for GUI)

Depending on platform you can install these dependencies as follows:

#### Mac OS

The easiest way to install depndencies on Mac OS is to use [brew](https://brew.sh/) or
[conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/index.html) package manager. For example,
once [brew is installed](https://docs.brew.sh/Installation) you can do:

```bash
brew install coreutils openmpi cmake
brew install --cask xquartz
```

Once these packages are installed, you can setup PATH as:

```bash
export PATH=/usr/local/bin/:$PATH
```

If the desired python version is not installed, you can install it using
[official distribution](https://www.python.org/downloads/mac-osx/). Also, note that
[Xcode Command Line Tools](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9329243/how-to-install-xcode-command-line-tools)
needs to be installed for development.

#### Linux

Depending on the platform (Ubuntu, CentOS, Fedora, Debian, Red Hat etc.), there are different ways to
install dependencies. For example, on Ubuntu:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y bison cmake flex git \
     libncurses-dev libopenmpi-dev libx11-dev \
     libxcomposite-dev openmpi-bin python3-numpy \
     python3-dev python3-scipy cython3
# for autotools based installation only
sudo apt-get install -y automake libtool make
```

We recommend using platform specific instructions provided in [nrn-build-ci](https://github.com/neuronsimulator/nrn-build-ci#scheduled-ci-builds-for-neuron) repository.

### Install NEURON using CMake

Starting with the 7.8.1 release, NEURON can be installed using the [CMake build system](https://cmake.org/).
One of the primary advantages of a CMake-based build system is cross-platform support and integration with
other projects like [Interviews](https://github.com/neuronsimulator/iv), [CoreNEURON](https://github.com/BlueBrain/CoreNeuron/),
[NMODL](https://github.com/BlueBrain/nmodl/) etc. These projects are now integrated into single a CMake-based
build system, and they can be installed together as shown below:

1. Clone the latest version or specific release:

  ```
  git clone https://github.com/neuronsimulator/nrn           # latest development branch
  git clone https://github.com/neuronsimulator/nrn -b 7.8.2  # specific release version 7.8.2
  cd nrn
  ```

2. Create a build directory:

  ```
  mkdir build
  cd build
  ```

3. If you are building on Cray systems with a GNU toolchain, you have to set the following environmental variable:

  ```
  export CRAYPE_LINK_TYPE=dynamic

  ```

4. Run `cmake` with the appropriate options (see below for a list of common options). A full list of options
can be found in `nrn/CMakeLists.txt` and defaults are shown in `nrn/cmake/BuildOptionDefaults.cmake`. e.g. a bare-bones installation:


  ```
  cmake .. \
   -DNRN_ENABLE_INTERVIEWS=OFF \
   -DNRN_ENABLE_MPI=OFF \
   -DNRN_ENABLE_RX3D=OFF \
   -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/install/directory
  ```

5. Build the code:

  ```
  make -j
  make install
  ```

6. Set PATH and PYTHONPATH environmental variables to use the installation:

  ```
  export PATH=/path/to/install/directory/bin:$PATH
  export PYTHONPATH=/path/to/install/directory/lib/python:$PYTHONPATH
  ```

Particularly useful CMake options are (use **ON** to enable and **OFF** to disable feature):

* **-DNRN\_ENABLE\_INTERVIEWS=OFF** : Disable Interviews (native GUI support)
* **-DNRN\_ENABLE\_PYTHON=OFF** : Disable Python support
* **-DNRN\_ENABLE\_MPI=OFF** : Disable MPI support for parallelization
* **-DNRN\_ENABLE\_RX3D=OFF** : Disable rx3d support
* **-DNRN\_ENABLE\_CORENEURON=ON** : Enable CoreNEURON support
* **-DNRN\_ENABLE\_TESTS=ON** : Enable unit tests
* **-DPYTHON\_EXECUTABLE=/python/binary/path** : Use provided Python binary to build Python interface
* **-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/install/dir/path** : Location for installing
* **-DCORENRN\_ENABLE\_NMODL=ON** : Use [NMODL](https://github.com/BlueBrain/nmodl/) instead of [MOD2C](https://github.com/BlueBrain/mod2c/) for code generation with CoreNEURON
* **-DNRN\_ENABLE\_BINARY_SPECIAL=ON** : Build special as a binary instead of shell script

Please refer to [docs/cmake_doc/options.rst](docs/cmake_doc/options.rst) for more information on
the CMake options.

#### Optimized CPU and GPU Support using CoreNEURON

NEURON now integrates [CoreNEURON library](https://github.com/BlueBrain/CoreNeuron/) for improved simulation
performance on modern CPU and GPU architectures. CoreNEURON is designed as a library within the NEURON simulator
and can transparently handle all spiking network simulations including gap junction coupling with the fixed time
step method. You can find detailed instructions [here](docs/coreneuron/how-to/coreneuron.md) and
[here](https://github.com/BlueBrain/CoreNeuron/#installation).

### Install NEURON using Autotools

If you would like to have GUI support, you first need to install the Interviews package available from GitHub
[here](http://github.com/neuronsimulator/iv) or the tarball provided [here](http://neuron.yale.edu/ftp/neuron/versions/alpha/).
In case of the former, first you need to run `build.sh` script to create the automake, autoconf, and libtool generated files:

```bash
sh build.sh
```

And then run the standard `configure`, `make` and `make install` steps to install Interviews:

```bash
./configure --prefix=/path/to/install/directory
make
make install
```

To build NEURON we have to use the same steps as Interviews, i.e., if the source is obtained from the git repository,
run `build.sh` script to create the automake, autoconf, and libtool generated files:

```bash
sh build.sh
```

and then run the standard `configure`, `make` and `make install` steps:

```bash
./configure --prefix=/path/to/install/directory
make
make install
```

You can set the following environmental variables to use the installation:

```bash
export PATH=/path/to/install/directory/<arch>/bin:$PATH # replace <arch> with x86_64 or other platform directory
export PYTHONPATH=/path/to/install/directory/lib/python:$PYTHONPATH
```

If you want to customize the build, particularly useful configure options are:

- `--prefix=/some/path` : Install in this location of your filesystem.
- `--without-x` : If the InterViews graphics library is not installed, disable GUI.
- `--with-iv=<prefix>/../iv` : If InterViews was not installed in <prefix>/../iv
- `--with-paranrn` : Parallel models on cluster computers using MPI
- `--with-nrnpython` : Use Python as an alternative interpreter (as well as the native HOC interpreter).
- `--with-nmodl-only` : Build nmodl only (in case of cross compiling)
- `--disable-rx3d` : Do not compile the cython translated 3-d rxd features

For additional options, see `./configure --help`.

Some systems require unusual options for compilation or linking that the `configure` script does not know about.
You can give `configure` initial values for variables by setting them in the environment. Using a Bourne-compatible
shell, you can do that on the command line like this:

```bash
CFLAGS="-O2" CXXFLAGS="-O2" CC=gcc CXX=g++ ./configure <other options>
```

### FAQs

* **I am getting link errors "undefined reference to 'tgoto, tgetent, tputs'".**

This is often an issue due to missing ncurses library linking. In this case, we recommend trying
`-DNRN_ENABLE_INTERNAL_READLINE=ON` CMake option.

* **I installed NEURON via pip but while using MPI I get "could not dynamically load libmpi.so or libmpich.so".**

NEURON will try to find MPI library in the standard library paths (e.g. /usr/lib). But on some systems MPI
libraries may not be in standard path. In that case you can try setting `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` (on linux) or `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH` (on Mac OS):

```bash
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/of/mpi/installation/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
```

In some scenarios this may not be enough (e.g. with Anaconda installed MPI) in which case you can explicitly
provide the path of MPI library using:

```bash
export MPI_LIB_NRN_PATH=/Applications/anaconda3/lib/libmpi.12.dylib
```

* **Can I move installation directory?**

As with any other UNIX package, it is not a good idea to move NEURON around once you've installed it,
because the directory names are coded into the files themselves. If you need to move it, put a soft link
in its original location that points to the new location (so the old filenames will still work).
Better yet, simply recompile neuron specifying the new installation directory.

* **How can I compile my mod files?**

	* cd to the directory that contains your .mod files.
	* type "/install/dir/bin/nrnivmodl" (or, if you put that directory in your path, just type "nrnivmodl")

This will create a subdirectory of the current directory which is your CPU name (e.g. `x86_64`). Inside this
directory is created the program "special", which is the neuron binary that you want to run instead of nrniv.

* **NEURON fails to launch because shared libraries cannot be found.**

Make sure to LD_LIBRARY_PATH or DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH environmental variables. For example, using bash shell:

```bash
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/install/path/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH. # on linux
export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/install/path/lib:$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH. # on Mac OS
```
