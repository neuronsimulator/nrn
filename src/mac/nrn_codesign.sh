# All binaries that will be part of the package must be signed with a
# Developer ID Application certificate in order to be notarized.
# The information in this file is not private since the installer may obtain
# signing info with, eg
# codesign --verify --verbose $inst/bin/nrniv
# codesign --display --verbose=4 $inst/bin/nrniv
# codesign --display --entitlements :- $inst/bin/nrniv
