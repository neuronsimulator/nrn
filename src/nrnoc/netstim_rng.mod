COMMENT
This is a copy of netstim.mod and created to demonstrate
the API of new RANDOM construct support in NMODL. All the
VERBATIM blocks, save-state feature and compatibility mode
with old hocRandom is removed.

Once all the futures are implemented in NEURON, the idea is
that this MOD file should replace netstim.mod.
