/* a point process is computed just like regular mechanisms. Ie it appears
in the property list whose type specifies which allocation, current, and
state functions to call.  This means some nodes have more properties than
other nodes even in the same section.  The Point_process structure allows
the interface to hoc variable names.
Each variable symbol u.rng->type refers to the point process mechanism.
The variable is treated as a vector
variable whose first index specifies "which one" of that mechanisms insertion
points we are talking about.  Finally the variable u.rng->index tells us
where in the p-array to look.  The number of point_process vectors is the
number of different point process types.  This is different from the
mechanism type which enumerates all mechanisms including the point_processes.
It is the responsibility of create_point_process to set up the vectors and
fill in the symbol information.  However only after the process is given
a location can the variables be set or accessed. This is because the
allocation function may have to connect to some ionic parameters and the
process exists primarily as a property of a node.
