/*
 *  OPTIONS
 *
 *  These are compiler options.  Set each option to one to compile that
 *  section of the code.  If a feature is not desired, set the macro
 *  to NO. Recommendations are given in brackets, [ignore them].
 *
 *  >>> Option descriptions:
 *  Arithmetic Precision
 *      The precision of the arithmetic used by Sparse can be set by
 *      changing changing the spREAL macro.  This macro is
 *      contained in the file spMatrix.h.  It is strongly suggested to
 *      used double precision with circuit simulators.  Note that
 *      because C always performs arithmetic operations in double
 *      precision, the only benefit to using single precision is that
 *      less storage is required.  There is often a noticeable speed
 *      penalty when using single precision.  Sparse internally refers
 *      to a spREAL as a RealNumber.
 *  REAL
 *      This specifies that the routines are expected to handle real
 *      systems of equations.  The routines can be compiled to handle
 *      both real and complex systems at the same time, but there is a
 *      slight speed and memory advantage if the routines are complied
 *      to handle only real systems of equations.
 *  spCOMPLEX
 *      This specifies that the routines will be complied to handle
 *      complex systems of equations.
 *  EXPANDABLE
 *      Setting this compiler flag true (1) makes the matrix
 *      expandable before it has been factored.  If the matrix is
 *      expandable, then if an element is added that would be
 *      considered out of bounds in the current matrix, the size of
 *      the matrix is increased to hold that element.  As a result,
 *      the size of the matrix need not be known before the matrix is
 *      built.  The matrix can be allocated with size zero and
 *      expanded.
 *  TRANSLATE
 *      This option allows the set of external row and column numbers
 *      to be non-packed.  In other words, the row and column numbers
 *      do not have to be contiguous.  The priced paid for this
 *      flexibility is that when TRANSLATE is set true, the time
 *      required to initially build the matrix will be greater because
 *      the external row and column number must be translated into
 *      internal equivalents.  This translation brings about other
 *      benefits though.  First, the spGetElement() and
 *      spGetAdmittance() routines may be used after the matrix has
 *      been factored.  Further, elements, and even rows and columns,
 *      may be added to the matrix, and row and columns may be deleted
 *      from the matrix, after it has been factored.  Note that when
 *      the set of row and column number is not a packed set, neither
 *      are the RHS and Solution vectors.  Thus the size of these
 *      vectors must be at least as large as the external size, which
 *      is the value of the largest given row or column numbers.
 *  INITIALIZE
 *      Causes the spInitialize(), spGetInitInfo(), and
 *      spInstallInitInfo() routines to be compiled.  These routines
 *      allow the user to store and read one pointer in each nonzero
 *      element in the matrix.  spInitialize() then calls a user
 *      specified function for each structural nonzero in the matrix,
 *      and includes this pointer as well as the external row and
 *      column numbers as arguments.  This allows the user to write
 *      custom matrix initialization routines.
 *  DIAGONAL_PIVOTING
 *      Many matrices, and in particular node- and modified-node
 *      admittance matrices, tend to be nearly symmetric and nearly
 *      diagonally dominant.  For these matrices, it is a good idea to
 *      select pivots from the diagonal.  With this option enabled,
 *      this is exactly what happens, though if no satisfactory pivot
 *      can be found on the diagonal, an off-diagonal pivot will be
 *      used.  If this option is disabled, Sparse does not
 *      preferentially search the diagonal.  Because of this, Sparse
 *      has a wider variety of pivot candidates available, and so
 *      presumably fewer fill-ins will be created.  However, the
 *      initial pivot selection process will take considerably longer.
 *      If working with node admittance matrices, or other matrices
 *      with a strong diagonal, it is probably best to use
 *      DIAGONAL_PIVOTING for two reasons.  First, accuracy will be
 *      better because pivots will be chosen from the large diagonal
 *      elements, thus reducing the chance of growth.  Second, a near
 *      optimal ordering will be chosen quickly.  If the class of
 *      matrices you are working with does not have a strong diagonal,
 *      do not use DIAGONAL_PIVOTING, but consider using a larger
 *      threshold.  When DIAGONAL_PIVOTING is turned off, the following
 *      options and constants are not used: MODIFIED_MARKOWITZ,
 *      MAX_MARKOWITZ_TIES, and TIES_MULTIPLIER.
 *  ARRAY_OFFSET
 *      This determines whether arrays start at an index of zero or one.
 *      This option is necessitated by the fact that standard C
 *      convention dictates that arrays begin with an index of zero but
 *      the standard mathematic convention states that arrays begin with
 *      an index of one.  So if you prefer to start your arrays with
 *      zero, or your calling Sparse from FORTRAN, set ARRAY_OFFSET to
 *      NO or 0.  Otherwise, set ARRAY_OFFSET to YES or 1.  Note that if
 *      you use an offset of one, the arrays that you pass to Sparse
 *      must have an allocated length of one plus the size of the
 *      matrix.  ARRAY_OFFSET must be either 0 or 1, no other offsets
 *      are valid.
 *  spSEPARATED_COMPLEX_VECTORS
 *      This specifies the format for complex vectors.  If this is set
 *      false then a complex vector is made up of one double sized
 *      array of RealNumber's in which the real and imaginary numbers
 *      are placed in the alternately array in the array.  In other
 *      words, the first entry would be Complex[1].Real, then comes
 *      Complex[1].Imag, then Complex[1].Real, etc.  If
 *      spSEPARATED_COMPLEX_VECTORS is set true, then each complex
 *      vector is represented by two arrays of RealNumbers, one with
 *      the real terms, the other with the imaginary. [NO]
 *  MODIFIED_MARKOWITZ
 *      This specifies that the modified Markowitz method of pivot
 *      selection is to be used.  The modified Markowitz method differs
 *      from standard Markowitz in two ways.  First, under modified
 *      Markowitz, the search for a pivot can be terminated early if a
 *      adequate (in terms of sparsity) pivot candidate is found.
 *      Thus, when using modified Markowitz, the initial factorization
 *      can be faster, but at the expense of a suboptimal pivoting
 *      order that may slow subsequent factorizations.  The second
 *      difference is in the way modified Markowitz breaks Markowitz
 *      ties.  When two or more elements are pivot candidates and they
 *      all have the same Markowitz product, then the tie is broken by
 *      choosing the element that is best numerically.  The numerically
 *      best element is the one with the largest ratio of its magnitude
 *      to the magnitude of the largest element in the same column,
 *      excluding itself.  The modified Markowitz method results in
 *      marginally better accuracy.  This option is most appropriate
 *      for use when working with very large matrices where the initial
 *      factor time represents an unacceptable burden. [NO]
 *  DELETE
 *      This specifies that the spDeleteRowAndCol() routine
 *      should be compiled.  Note that for this routine to be
 *      compiled, both DELETE and TRANSLATE should be set true.
 *  STRIP
 *      This specifies that the spStripFills() routine should be compiled.
 *  MODIFIED_NODAL
 *      This specifies that the routine that preorders modified node
 *      admittance matrices should be compiled.  This routine results
 *      in greater speed and accuracy if used with this type of
 *      matrix.
 *  QUAD_ELEMENT
 *      This specifies that the routines that allow four related
 *      elements to be entered into the matrix at once should be
 *      compiled.  These elements are usually related to an
 *      admittance.  The routines affected by QUAD_ELEMENT are the
 *      spGetAdmittance, spGetQuad and spGetOnes routines.
 *  TRANSPOSE
 *      This specifies that the routines that solve the matrix as if
 *      it was transposed should be compiled.  These routines are
 *      useful when performing sensitivity analysis using the adjoint
 *      method.
 *  SCALING
 *      This specifies that the routine that performs scaling on the
 *      matrix should be complied.  Scaling is not strongly
 *      supported.  The routine to scale the matrix is provided, but
 *      no routines are provided to scale and descale the RHS and
 *      Solution vectors.  It is suggested that if scaling is desired,
 *      it only be preformed when the pivot order is being chosen [in
 *      spOrderAndFactor()].  This is the only time scaling has
 *      an effect.  The scaling may then either be removed from the
 *      solution by the user or the scaled factors may simply be
 *      thrown away. [NO]
 *  DOCUMENTATION
 *      This specifies that routines that are used to document the
 *      matrix, such as spPrint() and spFileMatrix(), should be
 *      compiled.
 *  DETERMINANT
 *      This specifies that the routine spDeterminant() should be complied.
 *  STABILITY
 *      This specifies that spLargestElement() and spRoundoff() should
 *      be compiled.  These routines are used to check the stability (and
 *      hence the quality of the pivoting) of the factorization by
 *      computing a bound on the size of the element is the matrix E =
 *      A - LU.  If this bound is very high after applying
 *      spOrderAndFactor(), then the pivot threshold should be raised.
 *      If the bound increases greatly after using spFactor(), then the
 *      matrix should probably be reordered.
 *  CONDITION
 *      This specifies that spCondition() and spNorm(), the code that
 *      computes a good estimate of the condition number of the matrix,
 *      should be compiled.
 *  PSEUDOCONDITION
 *      This specifies that spPseudoCondition(), the code that computes
 *      a crude and easily fooled indicator of ill-conditioning in the
 *      matrix, should be compiled.
 *  MULTIPLICATION
 *      This specifies that the routines to multiply the unfactored
 *      matrix by a vector should be compiled.
 *  FORTRAN
 *      This specifies that the FORTRAN interface routines should be
 *      compiled.  When interfacing to FORTRAN programs, the ARRAY_OFFSET
 *      options should be set to NO.
 *  DEBUG
 *      This specifies that additional error checking will be compiled.
 *      The type of error checked are those that are common when the
 *      matrix routines are first integrated into a user's program.  Once
 *      the routines have been integrated in and are running smoothly, this
 *      option should be turned off.

/*
 *  MATRIX CONSTANTS
 *
 *  These constants are used throughout the sparse matrix routines.  They
 *  should be set to suit the type of matrix being solved.  Recommendations
 *  are given in brackets.
 *
 *  Some terminology should be defined.  The Markowitz row count is the number
 *  of non-zero elements in a row excluding the one being considered as pivot.
 *  There is one Markowitz row count for every row.  The Markowitz column
 *  is defined similarly for columns.  The Markowitz product for an element
 *  is the product of its row and column counts. It is a measure of how much
 *  work would be required on the next step of the factorization if that
 *  element were chosen to be pivot.  A small Markowitz product is desirable.
 *
 *  >>> Constants descriptions:
 *  DEFAULT_THRESHOLD
 *      The relative threshold used if the user enters an invalid
 *      threshold.  Also the threshold used by spFactor() when
 *      calling spOrderAndFactor().  The default threshold should
 *      not be less than or equal to zero nor larger than one. [0.001]
 *  DIAG_PIVOTING_AS_DEFAULT
 *      This indicates whether spOrderAndFactor() should use diagonal
 *      pivoting as default.  This issue only arises when
 *      spOrderAndFactor() is called from spFactor().
 *  SPACE_FOR_ELEMENTS
 *      This number multiplied by the size of the matrix equals the number
 *      of elements for which memory is initially allocated in
 *      spCreate(). [6]
 *  SPACE_FOR_FILL_INS
 *      This number multiplied by the size of the matrix equals the number
 *      of elements for which memory is initially allocated and specifically
 *      reserved for fill-ins in spCreate(). [4]
 *  ELEMENTS_PER_ALLOCATION
 *      The number of matrix elements requested from the malloc utility on
 *      each call to it.  Setting this value greater than 1 reduces the
 *      amount of overhead spent in this system call. On a virtual memory
 *      machine, its good to allocate slightly less than a page worth of
 *      elements at a time (or some multiple thereof).
 *      [For the VAX, for real only use 41, otherwise use 31]
 *  MINIMUM_ALLOCATED_SIZE
 *      The minimum allocated size of a matrix.  Note that this does not
 *      limit the minimum size of a matrix.  This just prevents having to
 *      resize a matrix many times if the matrix is expandable, large and
 *      allocated with an estimated size of zero.  This number should not
 *      be less than one.
 *  EXPANSION_FACTOR
 *      The amount the allocated size of the matrix is increased when it
 *      is expanded.
 *  MAX_MARKOWITZ_TIES
 *      This number is used for two slightly different things, both of which
 *      relate to the search for the best pivot.  First, it is the maximum
 *      number of elements that are Markowitz tied that will be sifted
 *      through when trying to find the one that is numerically the best.
 *      Second, it creates an upper bound on how large a Markowitz product
 *      can be before it eliminates the possibility of early termination
 *      of the pivot search.  In other words, if the product of the smallest
 *      Markowitz product yet found and TIES_MULTIPLIER is greater than
 *      MAX_MARKOWITZ_TIES, then no early termination takes place.
 *      Set MAX_MARKOWITZ_TIES to some small value if no early termination of
 *      the pivot search is desired. An array of RealNumbers is allocated
 *      of size MAX_MARKOWITZ_TIES so it must be positive and shouldn't
 *      be too large.  Active when MODIFIED_MARKOWITZ is 1 (true).  [100]
 *  TIES_MULTIPLIER
 *      Specifies the number of Markowitz ties that are allowed to occur
 *      before the search for the pivot is terminated early.  Set to some
 *      large value if no early termination of the pivot search is desired.
 *      This number is multiplied times the Markowitz product to determine
 *      how many ties are required for early termination.  This means that
 *      more elements will be searched before early termination if a large
 *      number of fill-ins could be created by accepting what is currently
 *      considered the best choice for the pivot.  Active when
 *      MODIFIED_MARKOWITZ is 1 (true).  Setting this number to zero
 *      effectively eliminates all pivoting, which should be avoided.
 *      This number must be positive.  TIES_MULTIPLIER is also used when
 *      diagonal pivoting breaks down. [5]
 *  DEFAULT_PARTITION
 *      Which partition mode is used by spPartition() as default.
 *      Possibilities include
 *          spDIRECT_PARTITION  -- each row used direct addressing, best for
 *              a few relatively dense matrices.
 *          spINDIRECT_PARTITION  -- each row used indirect addressing, best
 *              for a few very sparse matrices.
 *          spAUTO_PARTITION  -- direct or indirect addressing is chosen on
 *              a row-by-row basis, carries a large overhead, but speeds up
 *              both dense and sparse matrices, best if there is a large
 *              number of matrices that can use the same ordering.
