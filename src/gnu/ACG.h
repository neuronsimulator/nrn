//	Additive number generator. This method is presented in Volume II
//	of The Art of Computer Programming by Knuth. I've coded the algorithm
//	and have added the extensions by Andres Nowatzyk of CMU to randomize
//	the result of algorithm M a bit	by using an LCG & a spatial
//	permutation table.
//
//	The version presented uses the same constants for the LCG that Andres
//	uses (chosen by trial & error). The spatial permutation table is
//	the same size (it's based on word size). This is for 32-bit words.
//
//	The ``auxillary table'' used by the LCG table varies in size, and
//	is chosen to be the the smallest power of two which is larger than
//	twice the size of the state table.
