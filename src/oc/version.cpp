Revision 1.1.1.1  2003/01/01 17:46:35  hines
NEURON --  Version 5.4 2002/12/23 from prospero as of 1-1-2003

Revision 1.1.1.1  2002/06/26 16:23:07  hines
NEURON 5.3 2002/06/04

 * Revision 1.1.1.1  2001/01/01  20:30:35  hines
 * preparation for general sparse matrix
 *
 * Revision 1.3  2000/03/27  14:18:12  hines
 * All sources now include nrnconf.h instead of config.h so that minor
 * option changes (eg in src/parallel/bbsconf.h) do not require recompilation
 * of everything.
 *
 * Revision 1.2  2000/03/15  19:02:16  hines
 * trying to merge nrn4.3.0 stuff that used imake into the nrn4.2.3 distribution.
 * Now called nrn4.3.1
 *
 * Revision 1.1.1.1  2000/03/09  13:55:34  hines
 * almost working
 *
 * Revision 1.2  1995/05/19  12:51:40  hines
 * change the oc version number and date
 *
 * Revision 1.1.1.1  1994/10/12  17:22:14  hines
 * NEURON 3.0 distribution
 *
 * Revision 2.116  1994/09/27  17:03:05  hines
 * when oc_jump_target failed then the next error could try to longjump to
 * a function that had already returned. fixed.
 *
 * Revision 2.115  1994/09/26  18:25:40  hines
 * fix warning on sgi
 *
 * Revision 2.114  1994/09/20  16:20:06  hines
 * port to dec alpha
 *
 * Revision 2.113  1994/09/20  14:50:42  hines
 * port to dec alpha (cxx thinks struct name inside struct is new def)
 *
 * Revision 2.112  1994/09/20  14:49:25  hines
 * execute1("cmd") will return even on execerror. Note: does
 * not surround with {}
 *
 * Revision 2.111  1994/09/12  13:37:14  hines
 * execute("~command") will eliminate tilde and execute command without
 * enclosing it in {}. This allows one to create func, proc dynamically.
 *
 * Revision 2.110  1994/08/18  12:19:15  hines
 * allow ob.sec.range[i](x)
 * this necessitated allowing parsing of ob[i](x) and then giving
 * an error dynamically.
 *
 * Revision 2.109  1994/08/17  19:48:49  hines
 * ocmain.o : get it from lib (nocable and ocnoiv too)
 *
 * Revision 2.108  1994/08/05  14:16:14  hines
 * show_errmess_always()
 * errno not defined from include file in hoc.cpp
 * NullArgument replaces null arguments in Imakefile
 *
 * Revision 2.107  1994/07/30  17:33:51  hines
 * checking whether bison or yacc is used
 *
 * Revision 2.106  1994/07/30  14:52:40  hines
 * pwman_place(left, top)
 *
 * Revision 2.105  1994/07/12  17:52:26  hines
 * more portable way of dealing with ocjump
 *
 * Revision 2.104  1994/07/12  13:47:54  hines
 * from last change there are 80 shift reduce conflicts
 *
 * Revision 2.103  1994/07/12  13:45:48  hines
 * can use constant objects of form
 * template[index].
 * now object names are printed in this format as well.
 *
 * Revision 2.102  1994/07/04  15:10:54  hines
 * only print Oc banner if not NEURON
 *
 * Revision 2.101  1994/06/29  12:37:28  hines
 * can switch between bison and yacc. so far I have never used the partial
 * parseing feature of bison anyway. This works around a problem on some
 * crays in which there is a bug in bison.
 *
 * Revision 2.100  1994/06/21  12:36:04  hines
 * allow recursive calls to interpreter even in case of hoc_execerror.
 *
 * Revision 2.99  1994/06/17  13:00:35  hines
 * a number of things fixed while looking at the test coverage of hoc.cpp
 * mostly just to allow coverage.
 * CBUFSIZE is larger than 256
 * array index computed with double arithmetic.
 * corrected handling of end of file while in comments
 *
 * Revision 2.98  1994/06/17  12:53:28  hines
 * when a hoc_exec_cmd fails another execerror is called since
 * otherwise the pc is invalid. at this time it is not possible to
 * recover while still interpreting since the interpreter is
 * initialized. This is not a problem with buttons, etc since when
 * they are running the interpreter at the top level and they don't get
 * control until the interpreter is done.
 *
 * Revision 2.97  1994/06/07  20:54:40  hines
 * anyname (eg local) can also be a mechanism name
 *
 * Revision 2.96  1994/06/07  20:46:12  hines
 * all_objectvars not setting objectdata when accessing arrayinfo
 * fixed
 *
 * Revision 2.95  1994/06/07  18:42:38  hines
 * allow redeclaration of names in templates that are built-in names
 *
 * Revision 2.94  1994/06/07  15:01:12  hines
 * no trailing blank after an object name
 *
 * Revision 2.93  1994/05/24  17:36:11  hines
 * allobjects() prints all object names with number of references
 *
 * Revision 2.92  1994/05/24  15:41:38  hines
 * allobjectrefs recurses on this. Fixed
 *
 * Revision 2.91  1994/05/20  19:13:58  hines
 * object_push(objref) and object_pop()
 * allow more easy saving of internal state of objects.
 * after an object_puhs(objref) subsequent commands are executed in
 * the context of the object til the next object_pop()
 * Warning: do not create new variables within one of these object contexts.
 *
 * Revision 2.90  1994/05/10  20:19:14  hines
 * global lineno no longer initialized when defined.
 * Note: there is a potential problem when calling oc_run() from
 * a descendent of an object since when there is an error, the highest
 * caller gets the execerror and not the lowest. it would be better ot
 * nicely unwrap all the calls instead of doing a longjmp
 *
 * Revision 2.89  1994/05/09  19:11:46  hines
 * call_constructor checks if object is a point process and if so
 * sets the Point_process->ob field so one can know the object given
 * the point process structure. This was done incorrectly a little while
 * ago.
 *
 * Revision 2.88  1994/05/09  13:54:21  hines

 *
 * Revision 2.81  1994/04/27  11:21:31  hines

 * templates can not make new objects using templates declared at the top level.
 * first looks for local templates though.
 * 
 * Revision 1.77  92/08/18  07:31:45  hines
 * arrays in different objects can have different sizes.
 * Now one uses araypt(symbol, SYMBOL) or araypt(symbol, OBJECTVAR) to
 * return index of an array variable.
 * 
 * Revision 1.76  92/08/17  12:49:38  hines
 * arrays in different objects can have different sizes. Now arayinfo
 * gets carried along in objectdata. arayinfo is reference counted.
 * 
 * Revision 1.75  92/08/17  08:19:09  hines
 * strdef, double, and objectvar can appear inside functions (any compound
 * statement). They are still global (within a template). When executed
 * (and if they are arrays) the old arayinfo is thrown away and the
 * proper aray storage is allocated. Note that arrays should at least be
 * initialized outside of a statement or else the parser will complain when
 * it sees the array syntax. next step is to give each array in each object
 * it's own arayinfo so they can have different bounds. At this time
 * they could be inconsistent. One should not try to have the same name
 * with different dimensions though.
 * 
 * Revision 1.74  92/08/17  07:32:05  hines

 * file.
 * 
 * Revision 1.73  92/08/15  12:41:32  hines
 * can pass object variable as arg to oc functions and procedures. Within

 * 
 * Revision 1.71  92/08/12  11:56:34  hines
 * hoc_fake_ret() allows calls to functions that do a ret(). These functions
 * can have no arguments and the caller must pop the stack and deal with
 * hoc_returning.
 * This was done so init... could be called both from hoc_spinit and from
 * hoc.
 * last function called by hoc_spinit in hocusr.cpp is hoc_last_init()
 * 
 * Revision 1.70  92/08/12  10:45:42  hines
 * Changes of sejnowski lab. also gets sred from hoc. Major addition is
 * a new x.cpp which is modified for screen updating following an expose
