######################### NMODL Abstract Language Definition ##############################
#
# PURPOSE
# =======
#
# Lot of information about language constructs is necessary at various stages
# like AST definitions, visitors implementation, source-to-source transformations
# etc. In case of small changes in grammar or AST definition, especially
# during development stage, we have to re-write considerable part of the code.
# The idea of "abstract" language definition is to define framework that can automatically
# generate part of this "mechanical" code. This approach has been used in some open source
# projects (e.g. compiler design courses, TableGen format in LLVM).
#
# During first prototyping phase we defined simple text rules inspired by compiler course
# assignment available at jazariethach/project6_CS160.git (no longer available on github).
#
# The basic format of the every construct specification was:
#
#       BaseType:ChildType => MemberType<member_name>
#
# Here "ChildType" is a new AST class that we are defining. "ParentType" is the base class,
# "MemberType" is the type of member variable with variable name "member_name". The name is
# specified in the angle braces "< >". This will generate C++ class definition like :
#
#       class ChildType : public BaseType {
#         private:
#           MemberType member_name;
#       };
#
# This specification format was sufficient for first AST design but as we started
# implementing more features and compiler passes, we need to add more information to language
# definition. For example, we need to make certain members vector, some are optional, some need
# specific method (getter/setter) etc. In the future we may need to make certain members private.
# Above text definition is limiting if we have to accomodate future enhancements.
#
# To overcome above limitation, we are moving to YAML definition format. This allows easy
# extension to language construct. For example, new properties could be easily added to
# exisiting specification.
#
#
# NOTE
# ====
#
# Old text specification has been converted to YAML format. The old documentation has information
# about how/why specific types were choosen for AST. You can find that documentation in the older
# commits of this file (e.g. a0a20e277ccf26752af4f648c245b4e06a44af20).
#
# YAML BASED RULE SPECIFICATION
# =============================
#
# Text based specification described above is very limiting in terms adding extra properties.
# YAML based specification allows easy addition of new properties. Below are some comments
# about the properties and specification :
#
# 1.  Every key in YAML specification is AST node
# 2.  The hierarchy defines parent-child class relationship
# 3.  members is an array of member variables of the class
# 4.  optional : indicates if variable is optional in bison specification (i.e. pointer)
# 5.  type : type of the member
# 6.  vector : if member variable is std::vector type
# 7.  prefix/suffix :
#         value  : indicates the value (i.e. string here) of prefix/suffix itself
#         force  : print value always even if member if null pointer itself (e.g. arguments)
# 8.  separator : for the vector data type, the separator for prinitng elements
# 9.  node_name : add get_node_name() method to class and return corresponding value as name
# 10. add : need to have addMemberType method for corresponding variable (todo : remove this)
# 11. order of the members is important and determines how constructors/nmodl visitor get
#     defined from python code generators.
#
# TODO : Add detailed information about YAML specification by porting old text based rule
# specification

- Ast:
    brief: "Top level AST base class"
    description: |
                  Ast is a top level, abstract base class defining the interface
                  for all nodes of Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).

      - Node:
          brief: "Base class for all AST node"
          description: |
                  Base class for all nodes in the AST. This can replace ast::Ast in
                  the next refactoring.

                brief: "Base class for all expressions in the NMODL"
                description: |
                        Base class for all expression types. This is one of the top level node
                        in the AST representing higher level expression constructs. %Expressions
                        can be a variable itself or complex binary expressions.

                              All statements encapsulating text block are stored in the AST as ast::String.
                              For example, nodes like ast::LineComment and ast::Verbatim block use ast::String::value
                              to store the underlying text:

                                    Non floating value in the mod file is parsed as an integer. For example,
                                    in the below code, integer literals like `0` and `11` are stored as ast::Integer
                                    in the AST :

                                    \code{.mod}
                                        FROM i=0 TO N {
                                            tau = X[i] + 11
                                        }
                                    \endcode

                                    \sa ast::Float ast::Double

                        - Float:
                            members:

                                  brief: "Value of float"
                                  type: std::string
                            brief: "Represents a float variable"
                            description: |
                                    Single precision float value in the mod file can be represented by ast::Float.

                                    \note Currently every float variable in the NMODL is stored as ast::Double and hence
                                    this type is note used. This will be changed soon for variables like ast::ParamAssign.

                                    \sa ast::Integer ast::Double

                        - Double:

                                    %Double precision float value in the mod file is represented by ast::Double.
                                    For example, float literals like `0.1` in the mod file are parsed as double
                                    and stored using ast::Double::value :

                                    \code{.mod}
                                        PROCEDURE foo() {
                                          LOCAL x
                                          x = 0.1 + tau
                                        }
                                    \endcode

                                    Note that the variables are not classified ast integer or float in the AST. The
                                    decision about variable types is done by code generation backends.

                                    \sa ast::Integer ast::Float

                        - Boolean:

                                    %Boolean values in the mod file can be represented by ast::Boolean.

                                    \note Currently this type is used as only flag in some of the AST nodes. Similar to ast::Float,
                                    this type was introduced for data type specific code generation support in the future.

                  - Identifier:

                      description: |
                              Base class for all variable types like ast::Name, ast::PrimeName and ast::Argument.

                              \sa ast::Number

                                    Whenever lexer encounters string variable, it returns a ast::Name
                                    type. So, along with ast::Integer, ast::Double ast::String and ast::PrimeName,
                                    ast::Name is one of the fundamental type in the AST. Many other variable types
                                    (e.g. ast::GlobalVar, ast::RangeVar) have underlying value stored as ast::Name.

                                    \note This node should be able to use std::string as value type instead of ast::String

                                    ast::Name or ast::IndexedName in the AST.

                                    \note With ast::Identifier as top level base class, this type can be
                                    removed in the future refactoring.

                                    In case of function definitions from different ast nodes like ast::FunctionBlock,
                                    ast::ProcedureBlock, the arguments are store in the ast::Argument. For example,
                                    in below NMODL construct, `weight` is stored as ast::Argument::name and `uS` is
                                    stored as ast::Argument::unit:

                                    \code {.mod}
                                        NET_RECEIVE(weight (uS)) {

                                        }

                              is base class and defines common interface for these nodes.

                                  or kinetic reaction schemes, their dependent variables or unknowns are to be
                                  listed in the `STATE` block. Below is an example of `STATE`:

                                    \code{.mod}
                                        STATE {
                                            m
                                            h
                                        }
                                    \endcode

                                    Note that the state variable specification has form of ast::AssignedDefinition and
                                    hence can have associated unit specification.

                                  statement of the form:

                                  Statement block is used to hold list of statements between `{ }`. This
                                  represents a new block scope in the mod file and has following form :

                                    \code{.mod}
