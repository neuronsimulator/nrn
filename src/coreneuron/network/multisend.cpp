Overall exchange strategy

When a cell spikes, it immediately does a multisend of
(int gid, double spiketime) to all the target machines that have
cells that need to receive this spike by spiketime + delay.
The MPI implementation does not block due to use of MPI_Isend.

In order to minimize the number of nrnmpi_multisend_conserve tests
(and potentially abandon them altogether if I can ever guarantee
that exchange time is less than half the computation time), I divide the
minimum delay integration intervals into two equal subintervals.
So if a spike is generated in an even subinterval, I do not have
to include it in the conservation check until the end of the next even
subinterval.

When a spike is received (generally MPI_Iprobe, MPI_Recv) it is placed in
even or odd buffers (depending on whether the coded gid is positive or negative)

At the end of a computation subinterval the even or odd buffer spikes
are enqueued in the priority queue after checking that the number
of spikes sent is equal to the number of spikes sent.
*/

// The initial idea behind the optional phase2 is to avoid the large overhead of
// initiating a send of the up to 10k list of target hosts when a cell fires.
// I.e. when there are a small number of cells on a processor, this causes
// load balance problems.
// Load balance should be better if the send is distributed to a much smaller
// set of targets, which, when they receive the spike, pass it on to a neighbor
// set. A non-exclusive alternative to this is the use of RECORD_REPLAY
// which give a very fast initiation but we have not been able to get that
// to complete in the sense of all the targets receiving their spikes before
// the conservation step.
// We expect that phase2 will work best in combination with ENQUEUE=2
// which has the greatest amount of overlap between computation
// and communication.
