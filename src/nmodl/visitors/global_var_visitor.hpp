/**
 * \class GlobalToRangeVisitor
 * \brief Visitor to convert GLOBAL variables to RANGE variables
 *
 * Some of the existing mod files have GLOBAL variables that are updated in BREAKPOINT
 * or DERIVATIVE blocks. These variables have a single copy and works well when they
 * are read only. If such variables are written as well, they result into race condition.
 * For example,
 *
 * \code{.mod}
 *      NEURON {
 *    	    SUFFIX test
 *    	    GLOBAL x
 *      }
 *
 *      ASSIGNED {
 *          x
 *      }
 *
 *      BREAKPOINT {
 *          x = 1
 *      }
 * \endcode
 *
 * In above example, \a x will be simultaneously updated in case of vectorization. In NEURON,
 * such race condition is avoided by promoting these variables to thread variable (i.e. separate
 * copy per thread). In case of CoreNEURON, this is not sufficient because of vectorisation or
 * GPU execution. To address this issue, this visitor converts GLOBAL variables to RANGE variables
 * when they are assigned / updated in compute functions.
