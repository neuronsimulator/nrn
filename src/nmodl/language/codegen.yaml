######################### NMODL Abstract Language Definition ##############################
#
# PURPOSE
# =======
#
# NMODL language specification in nmod.yaml takes care of representing NMODL language
# AST generation. This AST is sufficient for NMODL level analysis and optimizations.
# In order to perform code generation transformations, we need to perform various
# transoformations on AST and add new node types. For example, PROCEDURE and FUNCTION
# nodes in NMODL doesn't have return type (double by default).  Also, we can't represent
# code generation specific information (e.g. variable or function qualifiers) with the
# existing AST nodes. This yaml specification describe additional node types that can
# be used for code generation purpose. Note that they are using same inheritance
# hierarchy because we would like to use single AST to represent the NMODL with and
# without code generation transformations.
