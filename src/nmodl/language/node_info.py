"""Define node and data types used in parser and ast generator

While generating ast and visitors we need to lookup for base data types,
nmodl blocks defining variables, nmodl constructs that define variables
etc. These all data types are defined in this file.

TODO: Other way is to add extra attributes to YAML language definitions.
YAML will  become more verbose but advantage would be that the YAML will be
self sufficient, single definition file instead of hard-coded names here.
We should properties like is_enum, data_type, is_symbol, is_global etc.
