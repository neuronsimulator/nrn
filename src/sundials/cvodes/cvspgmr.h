 * Type : CVSpgmrPrecSetupFn
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------
 * The user-supplied preconditioner setup function PrecSetup and
 * the user-supplied preconditioner solve function PrecSolve
 * together must define left and right preconditoner matrices
 * P1 and P2 (either of which may be trivial), such that the
 * product P1*P2 is an approximation to the Newton matrix
 * M = I - gamma*J.  Here J is the system Jacobian J = df/dy,
 * and gamma is a scalar proportional to the integration step
 * size h.  The solution of systems P z = r, with P = P1 or P2,
 * is to be carried out by the PrecSolve function, and PrecSetup
 * is to do any necessary setup operations.
 *
 * The user-supplied preconditioner setup function PrecSetup
 * is to evaluate and preprocess any Jacobian-related data
 * needed by the preconditioner solve function PrecSolve.
 * This might include forming a crude approximate Jacobian,
 * and performing an LU factorization on the resulting
 * approximation to M.  This function will not be called in
 * advance of every call to PrecSolve, but instead will be called
 * only as often as necessary to achieve convergence within the
 * Newton iteration.  If the PrecSolve function needs no
 * preparation, the PrecSetup function can be NULL.
 *
 * For greater efficiency, the PrecSetup function may save
 * Jacobian-related data and reuse it, rather than generating it
 * from scratch.  In this case, it should use the input flag jok
 * to decide whether to recompute the data, and set the output
 * flag *jcurPtr accordingly.
 *
 * Each call to the PrecSetup function is preceded by a call to
 * the RhsFn f with the same (t,y) arguments.  Thus the PrecSetup
 * function can use any auxiliary data that is computed and
 * saved by the f function and made accessible to PrecSetup.
 *
 * A function PrecSetup must have the prototype given below.
 * Its parameters are as follows:
 *
 * t       is the current value of the independent variable.
 *
 * y       is the current value of the dependent variable vector,
 *          namely the predicted value of y(t).
 *
 * fy      is the vector f(t,y).
 *
 * jok     is an input flag indicating whether Jacobian-related
 *         data needs to be recomputed, as follows:
 *           jok == FALSE means recompute Jacobian-related data
 *                  from scratch.
 *           jok == TRUE  means that Jacobian data, if saved from
 *                  the previous PrecSetup call, can be reused
 *                  (with the current value of gamma).
 *         A Precset call with jok == TRUE can only occur after
 *         a call with jok == FALSE.
 *
 * jcurPtr is a pointer to an output integer flag which is
 *         to be set by PrecSetup as follows:
 *         Set *jcurPtr = TRUE if Jacobian data was recomputed.
 *         Set *jcurPtr = FALSE if Jacobian data was not recomputed,
 *                        but saved data was reused.
 *
 * gamma   is the scalar appearing in the Newton matrix.
 *
 * P_data  is a pointer to user data - the same as the P_data
 *         parameter passed to CVSpgmr.
 *
 * tmp1, tmp2, and tmp3 are pointers to memory allocated
 *                      for N_Vectors which can be used by
 *                      CVSpgmrPrecSetupFn as temporary storage or
 *                      work space.
 *
 * NOTE: If the user's preconditioner needs other quantities,
 *       they are accessible as follows: hcur (the current stepsize)
 *       and ewt (the error weight vector) are accessible through
 *       CVodeGetCurrentStep and CVodeGetErrWeights, respectively).
 *       The unit roundoff is available as UNIT_ROUNDOFF defined in
 *       sundialstypes.h.
 *
 * Returned value:
 * The value to be returned by the PrecSetup function is a flag
 * indicating whether it was successful.  This value should be
 *   0   if successful,
 *   > 0 for a recoverable error (step will be retried),
 *   < 0 for an unrecoverable error (integration is halted).

 *        an iterative method in its solution.  In that case,
 *        the residual vector Res = r - P z of the system
 *        should be made less than delta in weighted L2 norm,
 *        i.e., sqrt [ Sum (Res[i]*ewt[i])^2 ] < delta.
 *        Note: the error weight vector ewt can be obtained
 *        through a call to the routine CVodeGetErrWeights.
 *
 * lr     is an input flag indicating whether PrecSolve is to use
 *        the left preconditioner P1 or right preconditioner
 *        P2: lr = 1 means use P1, and lr = 2 means use P2.
 *
 * P_data is a pointer to user data - the same as the P_data
 *        parameter passed to CVSpgmr.
 *
 * tmp    is a pointer to memory allocated for an N_Vector
 *        which can be used by PSolve for work space.
 *
 * Returned value:
 * The value to be returned by the PrecSolve function is a flag
 * indicating whether it was successful.  This value should be
 *   0 if successful,
 *   positive for a recoverable error (step will be retried),
 *   negative for an unrecoverable error (integration is halted).
