Action items
============

Pre-release
---
- [ ] Create a cherrypicks branch where all commits go into new release and open a PR against `release/x.y` branch
- [ ] Create CoreNEURON tag on the `release/x.y` branch after cherrypicking required commits, update semantic version in its `CMakeLists.txt`, tag it & update submodule in cherrypicks PR
- [ ] Look out for ModelDB regressions by manually submitting and analyzing [nrn-modeldb-ci](https://github.com/neuronsimulator/nrn-modeldb-ci/actions/workflows/nrn-modeldb-ci.yaml?query=event%3Aschedule++) for the cherrypicks branch vs previous version
- [ ] Update cherrypicks PR:
  - [ ] Update semantic version in `CMakeLists.txt`
  - [ ] Update changelog below and agree on it with everyone; then commit it to `docs/changelog` in the cherrypicks PR (copy structure as-is)
  - [ ] Update `docs/index.rst` accordingly with the new `.pkg` and `.exe` links for `PKG installer` and `Windows Installer`

Sanity checks
---
- [ ] After cherrypicks PR is merged, make sure GitHub, Azure and CircleCI builds pass for `release/x.y` branch
- [ ] Run [nrn-build-ci](https://github.com/neuronsimulator/nrn-build-ci/actions/workflows/build-neuron.yml) for the `release/x.y` branch; see [nrn-build-ci guide](https://github.com/neuronsimulator/nrn-build-ci#azure-wheels-testing---manual-workflow) 
- [ ] Activate ReadTheDocs build for `release/x.y` & make it hidden. Check docs are fine after build is done.
- [ ] Run BBP Simulation Stack, CoreNEURON CI & other relevant tests
- [ ] Build release wheels but WITHOUT upload ([see details](https://nrn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install/python_wheels.html#publishing-the-wheels-on-pypi-via-azure))


Releasing
---
- [ ] Create new release+tag on GitHub via [release workflow](https://github.com/neuronsimulator/nrn/actions/workflows/release.yml?query=workflow%3A%22NEURON+Release%22). Note that the GitHub release will be marked as pre-release.
- [ ] Create, test and upload manual artifacts 
  - [ ] MacOS package installer (manual task, ask Michael)
  - [ ] arm64 wheels (manual task, check with Alex or Pramod)
  - [ ] aarch64 wheels (use existing `release/x.y-aarch64` branch for this, see [guide](https://nrn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install/python_wheels.html#publishing-the-wheels-on-pypi-via-circleci))
- [ ] Publish the `x.y.z` wheels on PyPI; see [wheel publishing instructions](https://nrn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install/python_wheels.html#publishing-the-wheels-on-pypi-via-azure)
- [ ] Once wheels are published, activate the `x.y.z` tag on ReadTheDocs
- [ ] Upload Windows installer from the wheels publishing Azure run (to get correct tag)
- [ ] Publish release on GitHub (edit https://github.com/neuronsimulator/nrn/releases/tag/x.y.z and un-tick the pre-release checkbox) 


Post-release
---
- [ ] Deactivate ReadTheDocs build for `release/x.y`
- [ ] Go to [ReadTheDocs advanced settings](https://readthedocs.org/dashboard/nrn/advanced/) and set `Default version` to `x.y.z` 
- [ ] Let people know :rocket:
- [ ] Cherrypick changelog and installer links to `master`
