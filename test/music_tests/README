After having installed MUSIC and NEURON and also having compiled
nrn/src/neuronmusic and installed the neuronmusic.so file in the
Python dist-packages or site-packages directory I do the following:

  mpirun -np 2 music test2.music

and get

  numprocs=1
  Rank 0: Event (0, 0.001175) detected at 0
  Rank 0: Event (0, 0.013825) detected at 0

and

  mpirun -np 2 music test3.music

and get

(For some reason, it is not possible to add -nobanner for test3.)
